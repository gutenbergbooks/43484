<p>For verily all men by nature were but vain who had no perception
of God, and from the good things that are seen they gained not
power to know him that is, neither by giving heed to the works
did they recognise the artificer; but either fire, or wind, or swift air,
or circling stars, or raging water, or luminaries of heaven, they
thought to be gods that rule the world. And if it was through
delight in their beauty that they took them to be gods, let them
know how much better than these is their Sovereign Lord; for the
first author of beauty created them: but if it was through astonishment
at their power and influence, let them understand from them
how much more powerful is he that formed them; for from the
greatness of the beauty even of created things in like proportion
does man form the image of their first maker. But yet for these men
there is but small blame, for they too peradventure do but go astray
while they are seeking God and desiring to find him. For living
among his works they make diligent search, and they yield themselves
up to sight, because the things that they look upon are beautiful.
But again even they are not to be excused. For if they had power
to know so much, that they should be able to explore the course of
things, how is it that they did not sooner find the Sovereign Lord
of these his works?</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>Are we to look at the Beautiful with our feet
firmly planted on the Natural, or are we to
look at the Natural from the apparently precarious
height of the Beautiful? This, after all,
is the dilemma of aesthetic, slow though men
have been to realise it. As we read the history
of Aesthetic Theory we are puzzled by the tentativeness
and the uncertainty even of those philosophers
who played the greatest part in moulding
human thought, until it dawns on us that, idealist
though they might be in all else, in this they
were unconsciously disloyal to their own systems,
being in some measure materialist.</p>

<p>An attempt to form a philosophy of religion
which should start from the generally accepted
facts of biological science and pass, through the
common experiences of personal relationship, to
the ultimate problems of Godhead and manhood,
left at the close a keen sense of something lacking&mdash;something
more than the lack of unity and
balance inevitable in work written and published
step by step. I had tried to find in Love, which
is the very nature of Godhead, an essential
impulse towards creation. It was clear that this
creation must be the creation of something <i>new</i>,
if it were to be justified; and the conclusion
which forced itself upon me was that the creation
of personal beings fulfilled this demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet an unsatisfied sense remained either that
even the experience of love reciprocated by fresh
personal beings could not be new for God with
that utter newness which belief in Him as Transcendent
and Perfect required, or else that His
experience was not always perfect. At any rate
something that would make this newness self-evident
was missing. Something vital had clearly
been left out. The one thing of which no account
had been taken was Beauty; and I began to consider
whether this missing something, all-pervading
yet intangible, was not Beauty itself. And
in Beauty I seemed to find what I had missed.</p>

<p>To Aesthetic has generally been assigned the
fate of Cinderella. Her uglier sisters, Epistemology
and Metaphysic, have monopolised the court
invitations, for the most part. Might she not,
after all, be destined to marry the Prince? A little
thought made it clear that, properly arrayed,
she would bid fair to outshine the others. This
book is not an effort to dress her in a new fashion.
Fairy godmother I cannot claim to be, nor have
I a magic wand. I shall only try to strip off some
of the rags, leaving her, like Psyche, to proclaim
her own loveliness.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to give a systematic
account of the development of aesthetic theory.
Such books as Dr Bosanquet’s <i>History of Aesthetic</i>,
and the historical portion of Croce’s
<i>Aesthetic</i>, from which works the following summary
is chiefly derived, fortunately make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
task unnecessary. Nor does any detailed criticism
of the work of others fall within the scope
of the present essay. My aim is merely to
suggest an idea, avoiding technicalities as far as
I may, and then to link it up with the Christian
idea of God on the one hand, and with the
development of the human soul on the other.
The very briefest note on the course of speculation
concerning Art and Beauty will suffice to
introduce the point of view that I wish to suggest,
which is that Beauty must be a first and not a
last consideration for metaphysic. To advocate
this is to turn his own weapon against Croce;
but that is inevitable. Croce claims that Beauty
is the expression of that intuition of Reality
which constitutes the first stage of knowledge;
but the philosophy of Croce is anti-metaphysical.
Since many, while agreeing with the great and
original discovery involved in his affirmation,
must disagree profoundly with his negation, it
follows of necessity that sooner or later they will
endeavour to hoist him with his own petard.</p>

<p>Aesthetic theories show a steady and yet very
remarkable change in the views of philosophers
concerning Art and even Beauty itself. The
Greeks tended, on the whole, to regard Art as mere
imitation. Thus, at best, the beauty produced by
artistic creation was inferior, because second-hand;
in fact, as Plato argued, the artist’s
representation was really third-hand, for there is
first the idea, then the concrete individual object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
then the representation. Stress was laid on
harmony, rhythm, order, as being indicative of
the homogeneity of an ideal world and therefore
admirable. But, being an incomplete reproduction
of nature<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, art could have no primary
importance. It might be evil or good, in its own
degree; and from the moral standpoint it might
be judged, for the beautiful and the good are not
completely distinguished. Being so judged, it
was found wanting. It is one of the tragedies of
thought that the beauty-loving Plato should have
been driven to formulate a theory which is the
negation of art, because it seemed to him that
art was simply the false endeavouring to masquerade
as the true. In Aristotle we find the
beginnings of a freer idea. Symbolism in art is
implicitly recognised, and there is some escape,
though not much, from the moralistic bond;
some dawning conception, though not much, of
the concrete expressiveness of artistic creation.
In the Middle Ages the mystical symbolic conception,
characteristic of Plotinus, was developed.
Symmetry and rhythm are beautiful because they
symbolise reason and divinity, and relate the
human soul, through the perception of order, to
the divine which created that order. St Thomas
Aquinas even goes so far as to say that in beauty
desire is quieted<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;presumably because satisfied.
We shall be led to disagree profoundly with this
statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Vico (1725), to whom Croce acknowledges so
great a debt, we will only here say that he was the
discoverer of the creative intuition, and this discovery
entitles him to the honourable position of
first founder of a coherent theory of aesthetic.
Vico was primarily concerned with the nature of
poetry. He showed that poetry was a ‘moment’
of the spiritual consciousness, by which a man
was brought into contact with reality&mdash;that it
represented a stage of knowledge <i>before</i> reflection
(and was therefore an intuition) and that it
expressed this knowledge (and was therefore
creative); while it was distinct from feeling, and
therefore free from the stigma which Plato
attached to it, and which led to his banishing it
from his <i>Republic</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Men first <i>feel</i> without being aware; they then <i>become aware</i>
with troubled and affected soul; finally they reflect with
pure mind. This dignity is the <i>Principle of the poetical
feelings</i>, which are formed by the senses of <i>passions</i> and of
<i>affections</i>, as distinct from the <i>philosophical feelings</i>, which
are formed from <i>reflection by reasoning</i>. Hence the philosophical
feelings approach more to truth, the more they rise
to <i>universals</i>; the poetical feelings are more certain the more
they approach to <i>particulars</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Poetry is thus placed on the imaginative plane,
says Professor Wildon Carr, as distinct from the
intellective, and this imaginative plane, or as
Croce calls it, degree, is furnished with positive
value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>By Kant we first find the problem of aesthetic
faced boldly and at close quarters. Kant’s
thought had led him to the formulation of two
Critiques, the one dealing with the world of
abstract reason, the other with the world of concrete,
practical experience; and no systematic
bond yet existed between them. The unity of
life itself made such a dualism intolerable, and
Kant sought the unifying medium in aesthetic
judgment, for judgment is pre-eminently a synthesis.
The domain of aesthetic consciousness, if
purely subjective by Kant’s interpretation, is yet
clearly determined. It furnishes decisions on the
quality, the quantity and the relation of those
objects with which practical experience makes us
acquainted, and with whose existence the intellect
is occupied. Yet beauty is for Kant subjective,
devoid of abstract conceptions, pleasing without
interest, destitute of content; though he fails in
achieving more than a verbal consistency in this
matter<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Subjective or not, however, it is symbolic
of the moral order, and owes its apparent
rationality to the Order which it symbolises. No
doubt it is through the doctrine of symbolism
that Kant is led on to his discussion of the sublime
as another species of the aesthetic judgment, yet
more subjective, yet more abstract.</p>

<p>With Schelling we reach the stage of philosophical
appreciation of the objectivity of beauty;
and, with this objectivity, of the relation of beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to historical continuity, both in its own expression
in the mind of man, and in the sequence
of objective episodes. The artist recognises the
eternal idea in an individual, and expresses it
outwardly, transforming the individual into a
world apart, into a species, into an eternal idea<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
The divine, successively expressing itself through
man, gives a unity and absoluteness to all reality;
and reality is the object of the aesthetic judgment.</p>

<p>We have not stayed to discuss, or even state,
the many definitions of the Beautiful that have
been given. Neither have we attempted to represent
the contribution of countless writers to the
problem. Our only object in this brief page of
summary has been to indicate the changing trend
of thought.</p>

<p>The Greeks reared their philosophic system on
an unstable foundation, because they looked on
Beauty as mere imitation. For them Art mimics
life as crudely as a company of strolling players
at a country fair mimics the doings of the great.
Art is dramatic rather than true.</p>

<p>But with less rigorous and honest minds than
Plato’s the instinctive love of beauty weighed
more strongly. Beauty was, at highest, too
ennobling to be wholly false; it must at least
symbolise the true. And when a more disciplined
thought was once more turned upon Reality,
without beauty the world seemed dual&mdash;hard and
cold, with theory and practice divorced. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
only bond appeared to lie in the region of the
judgment of values, itself essentially aesthetic.
Men born out of due time there were who
showed here and there flashes of deeper insight
before Kant’s systematisation was effected, but
to them came only sporadic glimpses of the
truth. These for the most part were men deeply
versed in the life and soul of man&mdash;the Dantes,
the Shakespeares, the Goethes. Only one was
pre-eminent in the realm of pure thought&mdash;Giambattista
Vico. With other thinkers the tide
rose and fell alternately, yet always moved from
the neap of Platonism towards the spring.</p>

<p>Then, at the end, in our own time, Benedetto
Croce set himself to formulate the first adequate
theory of the Aesthetic.</p>

<p>The importance of Beauty to any system of
philosophy that could pretend to completeness
had been more and more recognised. It was left
for Croce to grasp the truth that Beauty is not
judgment, but expression: the expression of the
intuition which is our first contact with Reality;
and that Aesthetic is the science of expressive
activity. Given this first movement of the spirit,
the other modes of approach to Reality follow&mdash;or
rather are involved, since no temporal series
is concerned.</p>

<p>Croce’s philosophy as a whole, and especially
his extension of the logical <i>a priori</i> synthesis on
which it is founded, is difficult to grasp; and for
the sake of those who may not have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
acquaintance with his own exposition or with
Professor Wildon Carr’s summary, a brief discussion
of one or two salient points may be
forgiven. It is only fair to state, however, that
it is not possible to give a really short and clear
<i>résumé</i> that will do justice to the most interesting
and elusive of modern philosophies.</p>

<p>We may begin by explaining what Croce
means by an intuition, what he means by the
<i>a priori</i> synthesis, and what part the relation of
the double degree plays in his system.</p>

<p>When you perceive an object, already you are
using two mental processes, which cannot in fact
be separated, or exist the one without the other.
In the first place there is simple awareness of a
reality. You objectify an impression without
arguing as to its reality at all, or relating it to
yourself or anything else. You merely characterise
the thing, and are aware of it as concrete
and individual. This is the Pure Intuition. It has
no admixture of intellectual process. And its
salient characteristic is <i>that it is made or expressed
by the mind</i>, and is indeed identical with this
expression. You cannot separate the intuition
from its expression. Moreover it is aesthetic in
nature. Its character is identical with the
character of the mind-process which makes the
vision of the artist and the poet.</p>

<p>But this intuition is at once generalised, and
related. The process of generalisation is the
formation of the Concept, and is characteristic of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the logical or intellectual activity. Moreover the
Pure Concept is universal, and expressive,
belonging to all individuals; concrete, and therefore
real. Pseudo-concepts, which fail either in
universality, expressiveness or concreteness, do
exist and are of great value, but this value belongs
not to the theoretical, but to the practical, activity.
‘Evolution’ is a pure concept, ‘chair’ a pseudo-concept.
For our purpose it is not necessary to
elaborate this point.</p>

<p>What does interest us is the relation between
the two theoretical activities of the spirit&mdash;Intuition
and Concept. They are ‘moments in
the unity of a single process.’ Neither takes a
prior place. “We cannot think without universalising,
and we cannot have an intuition
without thinking<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.” In other words, they are
related in a synthesis that is <i>a priori</i>. This means
that the intellectual activity which relates and
generalises the intuitions or presentations does
not depend upon them, but is as much a condition
of experience as are the presentations
themselves. Each of the two things, the intuition
and the concept, is essential to knowledge; the
concept is empty of content without the intuition,
but you cannot have an intuition without thinking
it. The two form an indivisible, organic unity;
neither able to exist without the other. You
cannot think without universalising, nor intuit
without thinking. This is the logical <i>a priori</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
synthesis discovered by Kant. But Croce proceeds
to use it in a wider sense, as we shall see.</p>

<p>These two elements then, the intuitional and
the conceptual, together constitute the whole
theoretic activity of knowing.</p>

<p>Now the first of these elements, the intuition,
is expression of a reality to the self. It is
essentially aesthetic, for aesthetic is the science
of expressive activity. In forming an intuition,
and expressing it, we compass Beauty, for
Beauty is expression.</p>

<p>But there is another side to the activity of the
spirit. Thinking and doing, willing and acting,
go hand in hand.</p>

<p>The Practical Activity begins as Economic,
directed towards particular ends. There is
individual action; but there is also action universalised:
directed to general ends: and this
action is Ethical. Utility passes over into goodness:
there is no good action which is not in
some way useful, there is no useful action which
is not in some way good.</p>

<p>Here again, then, we have two inseparable
activities, related, as are the theoretic activities,
as a first and second degree, yet each involving
the other. The relation is identical with that of
the <i>a priori</i> synthesis, and the term may be
extended to cover this relation also.</p>

<p>Finally, the two sides of the activity of the
spirit, the theoretic and the practical, are themselves
related in this same double degree by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
relation of synthesis that we may again term
<i>a priori</i>. The theoretic activity cannot exist
apart from the practical, nor the practical apart
from the theoretic. The relation is again the
same as that which obtains for the relation of
the elements constituting each pair of the four
‘moments,’ and for the pairs themselves. The
<i>a priori</i> synthesis is extended to cover all these
relations.</p>

<p>With Croce’s theory of Beauty we have already
made acquaintance. As we have seen, Kant laid
the foundations by his discussion of the judgment
of taste; Vico, by distinguishing the
imaginative from the intellectual plane, had
supplied the basal idea; but it was left to Croce
to see that Beauty is expression, or the form
given by the spirit to its intuitions, through
which it makes contact with Reality. It must,
however, be borne in mind that Croce draws an
absolutely definite line between the expression,
which belongs to the Theoretic Activity, and the
technical embodiment of that expression, which
belongs to the domain of the Practical. The work
of art affords simply the stimulus which enables
us to recreate the artist’s expression; and it is
the expression, not the work of art, that is
beautiful. The Beautiful is a distinct concept;
the Ugly is ugly in so far as it fails in distinctness,
through failure to express. Beauty is simply
aesthetic value&mdash;the value of the expressed
intuition; ugliness the lack of aesthetic value,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
through lack of clarity in intuition and expression.</p>

<p>It is needless for us to follow out the rest of
Croce’s system. The chief point that remains is
his identification of Philosophy with History&mdash;the
<i>thought</i> about the presentation of Reality
(Philosophy) with that presentation itself as an
unfolding of immanent life (History). This
identification really follows from the relation of
the double degree between the theoretic and the
practical. In thinking past history you bring it
into the present as a practical issue; and you
introduce the logical element in thinking it, but
you could not do so if there were not an intuitive
element in it intrinsically. Philosophy is historically
conditioned; without philosophy there could
be no history. With this line of argument, whose
affinities with the philosophy of Bergson are
obvious, Croce rounds off his system, completing
his demonstration that the only Reality is living
Spirit, immanent and unfolding.</p>

<p>Thus, according to Croce, the expressive
nature of the Intuition, as it objectifies itself,
and so differentiates itself from mere sensation,
is appreciated by the mind, and serves as the
first step in the formation of the Concept or
judgment of definition. For the Concept is expressive,
universal, and concrete. Through the
Concept we arrive at knowledge of Reality; and
this Concept reacts upon the Intuition, giving
rise to the individual judgment. Croce shows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
by demonstrating that analysis apart from synthesis,
and equally synthesis apart from analysis,
in any act of thought, is inconceivable, that one
must, by an extension of the logical <i>a priori</i>
synthesis, identify the judgment of definition and
the individual judgment. You cannot, like the
idealists, separate the concept from the facts,
nor, like the empiricists, the facts from the
concept. But neither in the realm of aesthetic
interest can you separate the fact from its
expressive intuition, or <i>vice versa</i>. The whole of
Croce’s system is, as he says, a philosophy of the
spirit, which is itself all Reality. The activity of
the spirit is twofold. In its theoretic activity
there are two stages, Aesthetic and Logic, each
involving the other, yet the first in a sense
independent because primary, the second dependent
on the first. In its practical activity there
are also two degrees, the Economic and the Ethic,
related to each other in the same way. Yet of
these two activities, theoretic and practical, each
involves the other, and in an <i>a priori</i> synthesis
each substantiates the other.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to examine the philosophy
of Croce as a whole. Some points of disagreement
with him will become manifest as we
proceed to develop our discussion of the nature
of beauty. Notably, we shall disagree with his
rejection of a metaphysic and his denial of a
God; since their inclusion is not really so inimical
to his system as he supposes, their rejection by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
him would seem to be in a measure an accident
of his circumstances, while their omission leaves
the why? of spiritual and personal being unanswered.
For the moment all we need is his
discovery that Beauty is Expression, Aesthetic
the Science of Expression; that to appreciate a
work of art is to create it yourself by entering into
the mind, and following the same path, as the
original creator of it; and, first and most important
of all, that our knowledge of the Real
owes its possibility and its first beginnings to the
movement of aesthetic intuition. It is a far cry
from Plato to Croce.</p>

<p>If the fine arts be utterly distinct, having
nothing in common save a background of emotion,
this Essay is a meaningless attempt to
express something which does not exist. It
stands condemned; and this condemnation it
shares with many nobler works. But if, as Croce
urges, each art aims at presenting, through the
practise of its own conventions, aspects of Truth
which are suitable to that special medium, no
effort to find a highest common factor of all arts
is necessarily doomed to failure.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_I" id="PART_I">PART I</a><br />
THE THEORY</h2>


<p>What is Beauty? Many have asked it, and
could find no answer because they understood
their question no more than jesting Pilate
understood his ‘What is Truth?’ But many
beside have asked it with at least a real desire to
understand. It was already in the mind of the
prehistoric artist who was the first to draw a
pattern or to sketch the mammoth, though no
doubt he did not put the question to himself.
It has been there, expressed or unexpressed,
wherever a man has had vision enough to find
his spirit stirred by a flower or a cathedral; a
fabric or the low October sun upon a sheet of
gossamer; wherever a man has tried to reproduce
nature on canvas or pour out his longing and
triumph in sound or written words. He has
cried out that beauty dwells only in his own
spirit, for there have been moods and days when
he could see no beauty in that which at other
times moved him deeply. Yet the agreement of
civilised mankind, at all events, that this or that
particular is beautiful is so widely diffused that
he cannot but admit that something in the object
itself must suggest the idea of beauty. Taste may
change, but the sunset and the rose are universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
acclaimed by all who have any aesthetic perception
at all. On the other hand, faced with the
vagaries of artistic fashion a man finds no
absolute beauty, and is driven to a subjective
theory, for he cannot admire the protruding,
distorted lip so persuasive to certain savages.
But no sooner is this theory constructed than
he is brought up once more against the difficulty
that an object is required before the sense of
beauty is aroused, and that men do agree in
attributing beauty to many things.</p>

<p>Because the perception of beauty involves a
judgment (which really belongs to the intellectual
process, and not properly to the aesthetic),
beauty itself seems too elusive for definition. It
has been left, as we have said, for Croce to formulate
the first satisfactory concept of beauty. He
saw what no one else had seen&mdash;that man’s first
contact with the Real, the first movement of the
spirit that stretched beyond a mere sensation,
was a creative act, an intuition not a judgment,
expressing the reality to himself. Beauty, says
Croce, is expression. Afterwards the man might
give his expression objective form through some
technique. Hence derive pictures, sculpture,
music, dancing, poetry, drama, architecture,
language itself; all the arts. Or the expression
of his intuition may remain simply as a formative
agent of his spirit. There are many mute inglorious
Miltons. But he has expressed his
intuition to himself, and it has formed a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
material for his conceptual activity, whether or
no he brings it far into the domain of the practical,
through technique, in order that it may subserve
some economic or moral function for himself and
other men. That he must bring it into the
practical in some measure, whether he does or
does not give it technical form, is clear to anyone
who has grasped Croce’s main thought. The
aesthetic intuition is for the individual, but he is
driven to universalise it by thought (<i>i.e.</i> logic).
It is of practical value to himself (economic
motive) and it is capable of being made of use
to others (ethical motive). Theoretic and practical
cannot be isolated from one another.</p>

<p>As aesthetic is to logic, so is economic to ethic,
and so is theoretic to practical; it is the relation
of the double degree.</p>

<p><i>A priori</i> synthesis unites each of the theoretic
and of the practical activities with the other, and
the same <i>a priori</i> synthesis unites the theoretic
and the practical themselves, of which neither
exclusively precedes the other in the circle of
Real Being. This <i>is</i> the life of the spirit.</p>

<p>Now in considering this theory of Croce’s we
notice at once that mind or spirit is for him a
datum, and that he assumes further that spirit
is active and is definable only by its activity.
He gives no reason for this activity. The cause
of this is not far to seek, for his whole system
is confessedly anti-metaphysical, and so, of
necessity, stops short of ultimate things. Life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
spirit, is for him the true mystery, and this is
immanent. There is no room for transcendence.
All he can say is that no philosophical system is
definite because Life itself is never definite<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Truth is always surrounded with mystery, an ascending to
ever higher heights, which are without a summit, as Life is
without a summit<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>The spirit, which is infinite possibility passing into
infinite actuality, has drawn and draws at every moment the
cosmos from chaos, has collected diffused life into the concentrated
life of the organ, has achieved the passage from
animal to human life, has created and creates modes of life
ever more lofty. The work of the spirit is not finished and
never will be finished. Our yearning for something higher is
not vain. The very yearning, the infinity of our desire, is proof
of the infinity of that process. The plant dreams of the
animal, the animal of man, man of superman; for this, too,
is a reality, if it be reality that with every historical movement
man surpasses himself. The time will come when the
great deeds and the great works now our memory and our
boast will be forgotten, as we have forgotten the works and
the deeds, no less great, of those beings of supreme genius
who created what we call human life and seem to us now
to have been savages of the lowest grade, almost men-monkeys.
They will be forgotten for the document of
progress is in <i>forgetting</i>; that is, in the fact being entirely
absorbed in the new fact, in which, and not in itself, it has
value. But we cannot know what the future states of Reality
will be, in their determined physiognomy and succession,
owing to the ‘dignity’ established in the Philosophy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Practical, by which the knowledge of the action and of the
deed follows and does not precede the action and the deed.
<i>Mystery</i> is just the <i>infinity of evolution</i>; were this not so,
that concept would not arise in the mind of man, nor would
it be possible to abuse it, as it has been abused by being
transported out of its place, that is to say, into the consciousness
of itself, which the spiritual activity should have and
has to the fullest degree, that is, the consciousness of its
eternal categories.</p>

<p>The neglect of the moment of mystery is the true reason
of the error known as the <i>Philosophy of History</i>, which
undertakes to portray the plan of Providence and to determine
the formula of progress. In this attempt (when it does
not affirm mere philosophemes, as has very often happened),
it makes the effort to enclose the infinite in the finite and
capriciously to decree concluded that evolution which the
universal spirit itself cannot conclude, for it would thus
come to deny itself. In logic that error has been gnoseologically
defined as the pretension of treating the individual
as though it were the universal, making the universal
individual; here it is to be defined in other words as the
pretension of treating the finite as though it were the infinite,
of making the infinite finite.</p>

<p>But the unjustified transportation of the concept of
mystery from history, where it indicates the future that the
past prepares and does not know, into philosophy, causes
to be pointed as mysteries which give rise to probabilities
and conjectures, problems that consist of philosophical
terms, and should therefore be philosophically solved. But
if the infinite progress and the infinite perfectibility of man
is to be affirmed, although we do not know the concrete
forms that progress and perfectibility will assume (not
knowing them, because now it imports not to <i>know</i>, but to
<i>do</i> them), then there is no meaning in positing as a mystery
the immortality of the individual soul, or the existence of
God; for these are not <i>facts</i> that may or may not happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
sooner or later, but <i>concepts</i> that must be proved to be in
themselves thinkable and not contradictory. Their thinkability
will indeed be a mystery, but of the kind that it is
a duty to make clear, because synonymous with obscurity
or mental confusion. What has so far been demonstrated
has been their unthinkability in the traditional form. Nor
is it true that they correspond to profound demands of the
human soul. Man does not seek a god external to himself
and almost a despot, who commands and benefits him
capriciously, nor does he aspire to an immortality of insipid
ease; but he seeks for that God which he has in
himself, and aspires to that activity which is both Life and
Death<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus Croce affirms that evolution, development,
is demanded by the very nature of spirit.
In spirit the problem of the one and the many is
solved. The yearnings of man towards something
higher, and towards a unity that shall lie
behind and stabilise all thought, are but expressions
of the nature of Life. The dissatisfaction
of such a thought is due to psychological illusion,
comparable to a “dream of an art so sublime that
every work of art really existing would by comparison
appear contemptible.” There is no intuition
that cannot be clearly expressed; vague
dreams of the Madonna of the Future end
inevitably in an empty canvas. So too, according
to Croce, is a dream of transcendence empty of
content, because inexpressible; based on no clear
intuition, but on a confusion between the
historical judgment and some vague conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of the transcendental. And thus the life of the
spirit is left a mystery.</p>

<p>We will not attempt any discussion of Croce’s
fundamental pantheism, neither will we as yet
criticise his definition of Beauty. Instead, we will
begin our constructive work by considering the
psychological accompaniment of a perception of
beauty and from that starting-point try to reach
a conception and a definition that will carry us
beyond Croce’s into a region less empty of love,
a region that shines with a light of its own. Dead
moons are lovely, but they owe their loveliness
to living light. Cold philosophies too are only
beautiful when a beautiful spirit makes them
seem to live.</p>

<p>Let us, then, turn to the psychological effects
of that which appeals as beautiful to some
individual mind, leaving on one side, for the
time, all consideration of the reason why a particular
object should rouse a sense of beauty in
a particular mind.</p>

<p>Now unquestionably the beauty we perceive
is never satisfying, or if it satisfies at all it does
so but for a moment. Almost at once dissatisfaction
follows, or rather unsatisfaction.</p>

<p>There is a yearning for something, a sense of
something lacking. It is vague&mdash;so vague that
the only representation of it that has ever
adequately expressed at once its aspirations, its
lack and its indeterminateness, is Blake’s drawing
“I want&mdash;I want.” Of these three things it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
compounded, of lack, of aspiration, and of self-ignorance
that knows neither what it lacks nor
what it desires; and these three determine its
salient character&mdash;that of an impulse. That it is
really an impulse becomes clear directly we
examine its effects. It produces a desire to
create. In the young, the uncontrolled, the
illiterate, the creative impulse may be definitely
sexual. Passion is undoubtedly stimulated in
simple natures by the beautiful, and we shall see
when we come to discuss the evolution of
aesthetic sensibility that this fact is of the profoundest
spiritual import. For the moment we
need only note that this sex-impulse is creative.
In natures artistically more developed yet not
truly originative, the creative impulse is a desire
to repeat the thing that has given this sense of
beauty&mdash;to paint the sunset, to play the sonata,
to declaim the poem. Yet even here we must
note the germ of originality. The repetition is no
mere reproduction. Elimination and emphasis
make it in some measure a new creation. This is
obvious in the less rigid arts, painting and music;
but it is present even where the form is definite.
Hear two different people, or the same person in
two different moods, read the same poem, and
see how different a thing it can be! In more
artistic natures still, truly original, the desire to
create is conscious, the desire to reproduce less.
The thing created need not, probably will not,
be of the same kind. The moon-glade on the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
enriching by contrast the blackness of the rocky
headland, will inspire the musician to write, not
a moonlight sonata, for true music is free from
sensuous symbolism, but a pure rhythm of sound.
To suggest visual symbols in sound is to prostitute
music, to drive it back into the sensationalism
from which it has freed itself. It is,
further, to confuse the mind by attempting to
combine two incompatible media of technical
expression. As animal passion is to love, so is
Carrier’s “La Chasse” to a Bach prelude<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the psychological effect of
the beautiful is to produce a creative impulse,
based on the lack and the aspiration which give
rise to a sense of yearning desire. We see that it
is indeterminate, for it attempts to satisfy itself
in very various ways. We see that in so far as it
creates successfully, it finds some satisfaction.</p>

<p>Now all this fits admirably with Croce’s theory
of beauty. Beauty is for us the expression of
that of which we have intuition. In realising the
beauty of a symphony or picture we have ourselves
re-created the intuition of the artist. In
realising the beauty of a natural scene we have
expressed an intuition of the reality that lies
behind that scene; a creative act. We shall later
go beyond Croce in this matter, referring our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
creative act to a re-creation of the intuition of
God, and this will lead us to consider the
aesthetic meaning of God’s creation; but for the
time we need not pursue this thought.</p>

<p>Our next business is, clearly, to analyse the
yearning which precedes the creative act. We
have said that this originates in dissatisfaction.
What is this dissatisfaction? One other thing
produces a feeling that is not merely analogous,
but absolutely identical. When you love a
person intensely and are uncertain if it is reciprocated,
because no sign, or no sufficient sign,
is given, you experience the same dissatisfaction,
the same yearning and the same creative impulse.
In primitive natures the impulse may fulfil
itself in sexual excitement; in higher ones it is
expressed in art. It is a commonplace to say
that some of the world’s greatest creative work
is done under the stimulus of love. The poems
of lovers furnish the most prominent example,
not only their love poems, but the poems inspired
by their love, like the <i>Divina Commedia</i>; but we
need not seek far for examples in the other arts.
Beethoven’s Fourth Symphony was inspired by
his love for the Countess Theresa von Brunswick.
Tchaikovsky found inspiration in his Platonic
love for Nadejda von Meck, whom he had never
seen. His sad, abnormal friendships were an
inspiration to Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>Now in both cases, paradoxical as it may seem,
the dissatisfaction is due to receiving without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
giving. At first sight this seems to be exactly the
opposite of the truth. Surely a man is pouring
out his love, and receiving no return, one is
inclined to say. But a moment’s thought will
convince us that the first statement is the true
one. All the beauty, all the grace, all the interest
and the charms of the loved one are given to us
in unstinted measure, and we can give nothing
in return. We may not even express our love,
our desire to serve, but in the trivial services that
convention allows. Yet how we prize these little
services that we can render! How we seek out
opportunity of rendering them! We receive; we
can give no adequate return. It is that which
determines our dissatisfaction. If the gift of our
love is refused, dissatisfaction is most poignant.
Commonly we say that the beloved refuses to
give anything in such a case. Exactly the reverse
is true. The beloved gives, and cannot avoid
giving, but will receive nothing from us.</p>

<p>Now think of a perfect marriage or a perfect
friendship. There is little trace of dissatisfaction
there; only rest and happiness. We receive, but
we give again, and our gift may be given without
measure; may equal, or nearly equal what we
receive; may at least be all that we can give.
There is perfect reciprocity, and in reciprocity
we find rest.</p>

<p>The creative impulse does not cease, service
and gifts do not cease, but the spirit is free from
longing dissatisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Turn now to the dissatisfaction produced by
appreciation of the beautiful. We receive everything,
we can give nothing at all (to the beautiful
thing); and so dissatisfaction is at its highest.
We love the thing in which we find beauty, but
the love is one-sided. The cases are identical. It
is no mere phrase when we speak of the love of
beauty and the beauty of love. Unwittingly we
express the truth of an absolute interdependence.
<i>Love is relationship, beauty the expression of
relationship.</i> In this sentence lies our thesis.
Croce calls Beauty the expression of an Intuition;
we shall define that intuition as the intuition of
Relationship, Love being the relationship itself,
intuitively known; known, that is, as Reality&mdash;as
the fundamental quality of Personal Being, which
is the only ultimate Reality. Because the intuition
of Love is expressed, it enters immediately
the domain of Aesthetic. Doubtless it is conceptualised;
and hand in hand with this theoretic
activity of the spirit goes the practical. Love is
essentially practical, and, as Croce says, you can
never separate or give priority to either the
theoretic or the practical activity. The difference,
then, between beauty and love that is returned
lies in the fact that in the second there is reciprocity.
You give, as well as receiving. In all
love there is some reciprocity; the loved one
cannot help being conscious of, and receiving,
something of the spirit that moves out in such
wise. The love of a being seen but once is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
purely aesthetic. Only this corresponds to the
aesthetic appreciation of a scene, and even this
not exactly; for the being is potentially capable
of receiving, the scene is not.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing at this point that, though
Greek thought arrived at no adequate idea of
beauty, Greek Mythology did arrive at complete
understanding. And this gives little cause for
wonder, considering to what a level the love of
the beautiful developed in ancient Greece, and
considering too how myth represents the unreasoned,
intuitive wishes and ideas of an
infantile age<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. We often wonder at the depths
which mythology plumbs. Accepting Croce’s
scheme, it is the more easy to understand. The
myth of Pygmalion is subtly suggestive. Pygmalion
created beauty, and longed for it to reciprocate
his love, and out of his longing life and
love were born. Beauty was for him one-sided
love; hence his yearning and his dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>But we are not Pygmalions. Our Galatea
never comes to life. Why then should we strive
still to create? Why like the man in the old play,
should we proceed with an endless task: “When
will you finish Campaspe?” “Never finish, for
always in absolute beauty there is somewhat
above art<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.” Croce simply takes activity as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
character of spirit and leaves it at that, admitting,
but not really explaining, the fact that men are
dissatisfied with the mystery of it all. We,
approaching with a different presupposition,
accepting God and not rejecting metaphysic,
may hope to find some fuller explanation. We
do in fact go on creating something that cannot
reciprocate. Why? First of all, by our creative
act we learn more of the meaning of the Reality
that is around us, and the Reality that is ourself.
We find the creative godhead of our personality,
we exercise our self in its true function of godhead.
Moreover, we create a gift to other men,
whether technically or otherwise. If we cannot
give to nature, we can at least give our understanding
of nature to our fellows:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Better to sit at the water’s birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a sea of waves to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live in the love that floweth forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the love that floweth in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Be thy heart a well of love, my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowing, and free, and sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a cistern of love, though undefiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps not the spirit pure<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And neither does the spirit that is a cistern of
beauty fulfil itself, nor remain pure.</p>

<p>Our aesthetic activity is, then, our first contact
with Reality, paving the way to an understanding
of the meaning of that Reality. In spite of Croce,
we cannot agree that a full appreciation of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
meaning could be considered as achieved if the
end is simply longing&mdash;dissatisfaction. In the
very fact that beauty produces in us a yearning,
that issues in a creative activity which does not,
and cannot, satisfy the yearning, we have
evidence that the solution is not found. In the
identity of psychological content produced by
beauty and by unrequited love we find the clue
we seek. In the restfulness of a perfect friendship,
of an intercourse which knows no subject
that must not be touched upon, fears no jarring
note, whatever matter comes upon the scene,
can give all the keys in perfect trust, knowing
that trust will never be regretted, and hold the
other’s keys knowing there is the same confidence
on that side; that can see with the other’s eyes,
and never fear to be itself misunderstood; in that
restfulness the problems of beauty, of life, of
Reality itself find answer.</p>

<p>Let us repeat. The unsatisfyingness of beauty
is due to the fact that you are taking and not
giving. In order to give <i>something</i>, to others,
though not to the object that roused in you the
sense of beauty, you create by some technique.
What is it you are receiving? An intuition, which
you express to yourself creatively and to others
through its effect on your character;&mdash;to which
further, if you are an artist, you give external,
technical expression. This intuition which you
receive is the first stage of knowledge&mdash;of the
knowledge of Reality. So far, agreeing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Croce, we agree with Bergson; and moreover we
leave room for mysticism, since mysticism becomes
the appreciation of relationship, and logic
paves the way for suitable activity to develop our
side of the relationship. The meaning of this
becomes clearer when we consider Croce’s explanation
of the process of perceiving beauty in
the work of an artist, be it picture, symphony,
or poem. He points out that in appreciating a
work of art you enter into the mind of the
creator, follow his intuition, and create the
expression afresh for yourself. On the degree in
which you can do this depends the fullness of
your appreciation of the work.</p>

<p>But when you see beauty in a natural object
the matter is less clear. Croce would say that
you are in the first stage of knowing that object,
and he is unquestionably right so far. But can
we not, using the analogy of the picture or the
poem, go on to say that you are following out
the idea of the creator of the natural object&mdash;that
you are in touch with the Cosmic Idea, which is
the Idea of a Personal God? If so, there is indeed
room for mysticism, for mysticism becomes
simply the realisation that you are in fact doing
this. Moreover, Beauty and Love at once fall
into relation. Beauty is not simply expression,
but the expression of a relation, and it is incomplete
because the relation is not yet reciprocal.
Love is that relation itself.</p>

<p>In another aspect, beauty is seen as the meeting-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>place
for love, since it is the expression of an
intuition of Reality, and Reality is rooted and
grounded in love. Where there is limitation
either of one or both of two persons, expression
is needed to provide a meeting-place&mdash;speech or
sign for the lesser artist, music, poetry, or picture
for the greater. Each expression is a symbol of
the reality it incarnates; in so far as it reaches
out beyond its own immediate apprehension of
that reality. All expression, all art, is symbolic
and has a mystical aspect, else it would be either
complete and all-embracing or devoid of real
content. So far the symbolists are right.</p>

<p>But this opens up a wide problem. If Beauty
be the formulated intuition of Reality, which, because
of its incompleteness, represents in symbols
things that are beyond its immediate purview,
and if Reality be, as we have elsewhere argued<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>,
grounded on Personal Relationship, the self-expression
of Love, does beauty cease when
personal relations become perfect? For we have
argued that a symbol belongs to the domain of
the imperfect, not the perfect<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. If so, has beauty
any meaning for God? At this point we clearly
come into contact with the problem of God’s
creative activity. We have said<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that the creation
of God must be the creation of something new.
We have said that Love, of its own nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
demands expansion, is centrifugal as well as
centripetal, and in this centrifugality of love we
sought the Divine Impulse to create new personalities.
But behind lurked always the question
“How could a God whose experience was perfect
and embraced already all Reality, create anything
that was new?” The reciprocity of perfected
love would be new for the personal beings He
had created; but His self-limitation which the
freedom of those beings necessitated would not
be new for Him, for self-abnegation is an eternal
part of love, since love is substantiated as itself
by creative self-surrender, transcendence by immanence.
Would the <i>result</i> of His self-limitation
be new for Him, implicit as it is in His Being as
Love? Would the experience of the reciprocal
love of His children be a new thing for Him?</p>

<p>No doubt the problem, as belonging to the
domain of the Transcendent, is not soluble for
us, whose transcendence, whose intuition of the
Real, is so incomplete. But because in such
measure as we do know the Real we are ourselves
transcendent, we can at least hope to touch the
fringe of His garment; and Croce’s proof that
pure intuition&mdash;which Bergson also urges to be
our <i>point d’appui</i> with the Real&mdash;belongs to the
domain of aesthetic, gives us a fresh clue in our
investigation.</p>

<p>Beauty is expression. This is Croce’s statement;
and in it we find what we need, provided
that we expand the definition into ‘the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of Relation.’ If there be a Personal God as we
believe, whose experience is Reality, He must
always be expressing that Reality. There is no
consciousness without expression. But the expression
of knowledge of the Real is Beauty.
God’s Being must be full of an overwhelming
Beauty. But part of His Nature, as Love, is
centrifugal. That centrifugal part must also be
expressed. The artist follows his expression by
technical application; he paints for eye or ear,
to satisfy himself and to communicate his
intuition. In so far as he fails in his expression,
the result is ugly. In so far, also, as God’s
creation fails, through its own inevitable condition
of the freedom of man, the result is ugly.
Ugliness is the aesthetic, or theoretical aspect
of sin; in its practical aspect sin is uneconomic,
un-moral.</p>

<p>Now if one thing is more certain than another,
it is that Beauty is for ever new. Each sense of
beauty is a new creation, a fresh activity of the
spirit, be it inspired never so often by the same
object. And this means that to know the Real
is for ever a new thing. God’s love is always new
for Himself. His self-knowledge is creation perpetually
renewed. It follows, <i>a fortiori</i>, that His
knowledge of the beings He creates and is
creating is each moment new. Because knowledge
is in its first movement Beauty, there can
be no stagnancy in Eternal Being, no dead level
of satiety in Eternal Life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Beauty is expression. For God it is the expression
of His relation to Himself as transcendent,
and of the substantiation of His transcendence
through His relation to others as immanent, in
the first stage of the movement of that relation
towards and into transcendence. Beauty is the
expression of a relation, and is ever new. But the
relation itself is Love. God is Love; that love is
expressed as Beauty; and Beauty is necessarily
eternal, because it is the knowledge of Reality.
God is Love. This is to say that God IS because
He is a relation, to Himself and to others. Here
is the inmost heart of Trinitarian Doctrine, as
we have seen<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Because He is Love, He expresses
that Reality in activity. But activity has two
sides, the theoretical and the practical. His
expression is, on the theoretic side, Beauty, and
is hence for ever new for Him. He is for Himself
a Relation, known intuitively and expressed
as Beauty, and His intuition of this Reality is
ever new. On the practical side it is Creation,
full of purpose (economic aspect) and of goodness
(moral aspect); new for us, His creatures,
but only achieving, for us even, its full newness
as we come to know the Reality which is the
experience of the Love that is perfect in Him
alone; only achieving its full newness as we begin
ourselves to know, to express, and to create: as
we become gods ourselves. And what He
creates is real, beautiful, and new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Beauty is eternal. It is the meeting-place of
personal beings for ever; but it is a symbol only
so long as these personal beings are imperfect,
and their knowledge incomplete. Beauty and
knowledge become coextensive as immediate intuition
extends its boundaries till logic has no
more a place, or rather till logic and intuition
cover the same ground. So too with the practical;
the useful extends its boundaries till
it is coextensive with the good, and the two
become one and the same. The activity that
remains is as God’s activity. Love is itself
because it is both knowing and doing; absolute
Being is the circle of these two inseparables.</p>

<p>Before we proceed it will be as well to remind
ourselves once more of the psychological fact
that has caused us to modify Croce’s definition
of beauty by introducing the idea of relation.
This characteristic consequence of a vision of the
beautiful is the sense of longing, akin to the
longing of unreciprocated love, which issues in
some creative act. This act may be a conscious
attempt to produce something of aesthetic value&mdash;a
work of art&mdash;or it may simply be an attempt
to make our <i>milieu</i> harmonious. The housewife
may be stimulated to re-cover the cushions, to
tidy the house, or to re-arrange the room; the
mother may try to make her children happier;
the selfish man or the fractious child may try
to make life more complete and harmonious by
loving deeds, however short-lived. The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
commonplace mind may feel a religious impulse;
a sense of wonder and reverence. Men have
always been perplexed by the apparently close
connection between the beautiful and the good,
between the beautiful and the sublime. This
connection becomes clear in the light of our
definition. Beauty is seen as the first step
towards an understanding of Reality, and that
Reality is Love, personal relationship, reciprocity.
Relationship between finite persons first (yet not
transient even here, because personality is essentially
infinite, and persons are only limited in so
far as they have failed as yet to achieve personality),
but relationship that finds its origin and
explanation in the personal, creative, Triune
Being of God<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. The perception of beauty is
accompanied by emotion; free, as emotion is in
itself, though aroused by external conditioning<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>;
yet unsatisfied, thwarted, and so with a vein of
sadness in its joy. Its joy is the joy of beginning
to understand. All understanding is pleasure.
One smiled with pleasure when one first grasped
Euclid’s forty-seventh proposition, even. But
here we understand the beauty as a symbol and
a meeting-place. It makes us feel less lonely and
less isolated. Its sadness is the sadness of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
incomplete understanding. We see in a beautiful
thing a thing that can receive nothing from us,
while it gives much to us. Yet the very fact that
beauty does make us ‘feel religious’ shows that
somehow we do realise that we can give something
to God, and find a little satisfaction in
doing so; that even nature is not so impersonal
as we were inclined to think. Our desire to
create beautiful things is a sign that we understand
our self also, our destined godhead, and
that we too wish to reveal our self by creating
for others, and giving to others. It is a sign that
we understand that our relations with God and
with our fellows are reciprocal.</p>

<p>Croce gives the clue when he shows that
aesthetic is the first stage of the spirit’s activity.
Bergson strikes a note that wakes an answering
harmony when he urges that intuition brings us
nearer to Reality than does intellect directed
toward practical aims, even though some of his
deductions displease; Kant and Hegel indicate
the eternal value of aesthetic when they urge
that it belongs to the highest and last stage. But
Croce gives no reason for the longing that beauty
forces upon us; nor indeed for the activity of
spirit at all; he merely assumes spirit as a datum,
and is defined by its activity.</p>

<p>But if we regard beauty as the expression of a
perceived relationship, almost as one-sided love,
the whole falls into place. Through beauty we
get into touch with Reality, which Reality is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in its completeness, the mutual activity of Love.
The basis of Love’s activity is Love’s freedom,
even its freedom to limit itself. Mankind is
winning freedom out of determined conditions;
which conditions are the creation, the expression,
of God’s love, through self-limitation. Because
they are the expression of God’s knowledge of
the Reality of Love, they are beautiful. The
winning of freedom by man is achieved through
adaptative relation to the environment. As this
adaptation becomes conscious&mdash;as we gain intuitive
knowledge of the environment&mdash;the sense
of beauty is born, for we express our knowledge
of this relation to ourselves; and make efforts
towards further adaptation. These efforts are
creative; and as we progress our creation becomes
more and more altruistic; a creation for others
with our relationship to them held consciously
before us. These few words will suffice to show
how perfectly our thesis fits in with the evolutionary
views we have previously enunciated.
The development of this side of the argument
may be left for the present.</p>

<p>One other matter requires a brief consideration,
and then we can leave the general outline
of our theory and proceed to a more detailed
treatment of certain parts of it. This is the old,
unsolved problem whether beauty is subjective
or objective; whether a thing is beautiful in itself,
or whether it is only our thinking that makes it
so. Croce has made it perfectly clear that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
thing or the scene which we erroneously call
beautiful, meaning that it is beautiful in itself,
physically beautiful, is simply the “stimulus to
aesthetic reproduction, which presupposes previous
production. Without preceding aesthetic
intuitions of the imagination, nature cannot
arouse any at all.” Perhaps Croce’s own thesis
would gain in clearness and coherence if, starting
from the sense of beauty aroused by a work of
art as the re-creation of the artist’s intuition
by the spectator, he had accepted the religious
implication, and argued that appreciation of so-called
natural beauty, was the re-creation by man
of God’s intuition. But, with his prejudice against
religion, he naturally could not boldly accept God
as the Primal Artist, even though to do so would
have made his theory far more complete, and
would have saved him from relegating the chief
factor of man’s life to the realm of psychological
illusion.</p>

<p>To return to the immediate question, there can,
of course, be no doubt that since beauty is an
activity of the spirit, the expression of an intuition,
beauty itself must be purely subjective.
Equally, there can be no doubt that without the
objective Reality the intuition could never be
called into being. (We call it definitely objective
for man, since all our argument in previous
works has driven us to the conclusion that there
is a necessary dualism for man as long as freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
is incomplete, love imperfect; as long, that is, as
man is becoming.)</p>

<p>This grows more and more clear as one analyses
the things that have roused in oneself the keenest
sense of beauty. I think of a copse starred with
snowdrops and aconite amid bare trunks under
a steel-grey sky&mdash;a day in late autumn in water-meadows;
emerald peacock-tails of weed in the
river, and lights of madder and old gold&mdash;blue
sea covered with pearly Portuguese men-o’-war
and white surf breaking on black lava rocks&mdash;perhaps
a dozen such landmarks, to me a priceless
possession, to another about as interesting as an
album of picture-postcards from somebody else’s
travels. In mercy partly, partly in self-defence,
one withholds these things from all but the few
who care to understand. Let each fill in his own;
for there are in every life such moments, when
one is in touch with a larger life, and it is these
moments which make a man, as Masefield has
wonderfully shown in his poem <i>Biography</i>.
Then there are the hours when human triumphs
rouse in us the same ecstasy. Bach preludes and
fugues, with their palaces reared by perfect stone
added architecturally to perfect stone; the dainty
certainties of Mozart; the sad gaiety and foreboding
meditations of Chopin; the delicate
cadences of Swinburne; the lusty, open-air
searchings of Masefield, saddened by the obsession
of sunset transience; the gentle longing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the refrain of the <i>Earthly Paradise</i>; the massive
synthesis of the <i>Dynasts</i>; the sorrow of <i>Deirdre</i>
and <i>Violaine</i>; the ethereal atmosphere of <i>A Midsummer
Night’s Dream</i>; pictures&mdash;architecture&mdash;it
is all endless. Now the first thing we notice is
that if we are in the wrong mood these things
may have little or no appeal. I may walk in
Water-meads and feel nothing of their charm.
Bach may be mere noise, if I want to think of
something else. Again the Madonna of the
Magnificat may leave me unmoved, if my attention
is on other matters. Those whose sense of
beauty is really keen can never be unstirred by
the beautiful, unless their attention is so rivetted
on other things that they do not observe it at all,
but most of us are of commoner clay; we can
notice a thing yet hardly be aware of its beauty.</p>

<p>Here, in either case, our ordinary speech hits
the nail exactly on the head: “I am not in a
receptive mood,” we say. I do not receive what
these things have to give. In an appreciative
mood I take something from the thing that
seems to me beautiful&mdash;this act is my intuition&mdash;and
use it as the basis of my creative work&mdash;my
expression. I need the presentation of an external
object, or its memory, for that creation. Now, as
we have just seen, a host of very different objects
excite in an individual emotion of beauty in a
pre-eminent degree, while if we reckon the
objects which excite it in a less acute form, the
tale is endless; yet the emotion all excite is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
sufficiently the same in content, in spite of its
multiplicity of form, to be expressed by the
single term beauty. One is tempted to speak
loosely of this effect of the beautiful on us as an
emotion, though clearly it is not one, since it is
expression. An emotion may be beautiful immediately
it is known and expressed in this act
of knowing, but the emotion is not beautiful any
more than any other object is beautiful. Nevertheless,
this loose usage of the term has one
advantage. It draws our attention to the close
relationship that binds together beauty and
emotion. We have seen elsewhere that in the
realm of emotion exists the freedom that lies
between the incoming perception and the outgoing
activity, forming the bond between the
first and last, and determining the form of the
response to the stimulus<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. In the recognition of
beauty there is freedom and emotion, as there is
in every creative act. But the activity is dependent
on stimulus, and every stimulus is primarily
perceptual, though not necessarily in the strict
sense of being perceived by an organ of sense.
The perception may be wholly internal, the self
being its own object in introspection<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; the
intuition may be the intuition of love itself. Here
we see the origin of the common, yet I believe
erroneous, statement that “beauty, as we understand
it, is only for sense and for sensuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
imagination<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.” If Beauty be the expression of an
intuition of Reality, as Croce says, and Reality
be ultimately the activity of Personal Being,
which activity is relationship, as we have seen
reason to claim<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, Beauty is not dependent on
sense perception alone. Further, because the
activity of personal relation is Love, we see in
Beauty the creative knowledge of love, which is
necessarily linked in closest intimacy with
freedom and emotion. Love is not beautiful; it
is simply the activity of relationship. The knowledge
of love is Beauty’s very self. The world is
not beautiful, but knowledge of the world as the
expression of a part of Reality&mdash;of that portion
of Reality which is limited and determined by
the self-abnegation of God’s love&mdash;is Beauty. In
so far as we merely perceive matter the aesthetic
side is in abeyance. At this moment we know,
not Reality, but Appearance. Our unaesthetic
moods are determined by our more or less complete
practical concern with Appearance, our
more or less complete blindness to Reality. We
have gone back to a lower, more primitive stage.
In our limited and still largely determined
existence we are bound to be occupied in a great
measure with appearance. The practical must
dominate the theoretic activity; the spirit must
be unbalanced, asymmetrical. Even in our
moments of greatest symmetry our apprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of the Real is largely at second hand. <i>Pace</i>,
Croce, we would say&mdash;as we have said already<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;that
the Immanent cannot have immediate contact
with the Real; man’s intuitions belong to his
transcendence where they deal with the absolutely
Real. Man immanent and limited is immediately
in contact with God immanent and self-limited;
only in so far as man is transcendent is he in
contact with God Transcendent, and so in touch
with the Whole. In his immanence man lives
by symbols, which are sacraments; and here
we find the symbolic aspect of Beauty. It is the
material basis of this symbolic side of Beauty,
rather than Beauty absolute, that has of necessity
received most attention hitherto; and the
puzzles of rival theories have arisen through
failure to realise that a symbol is a partial expression
of a reality, and that it can only be fully
grasped when the reality which it symbolises is
understood. A symbol has something of the
reality itself, or it would not be a symbol, but it
does not represent that reality adequately, or it
would be co-extensive with it; would <i>be</i> the
reality itself. Beauty is thus subjective, in so
far as it is necessarily the work of the spirit.
But it is objective in so far as the reality of which
it is the knowledge is personal and external to
the self, and will always remain external, however
complete the interpenetration of personalities,
since personalities cannot be merged and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
lost in each other, but remain eternally in their
self-identity<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>A natural object <i>per se</i> is not beautiful; only
so far as it is understood as a partial representation
of Reality, a symbol, is it beautiful.</p>

<p>Naturally, this statement arouses the objection
that to most people the music of Grieg, if not of
Bach, the pictures of Leighton, if not of Utamaro,
are beautiful; and that there is a general consensus
of opinion that the view over the Severn
from the Windcliff, or the view of Lisbon from
the harbour is more beautiful than Wormwood
Scrubbs. The answer to the first part of this
objection is obvious. In music, painting, verse,
we are re-creating for ourselves the artist’s intuition.
We know that he found beauty, and he
has abstracted in his art in such a way as to
render the beauty more easily recaptured. The
artist is then our guide. He was an artist because
his spirit was more sensitive to the reality than
ours, and we follow him.</p>

<p>But in natural beauty, too, is not this true?
Primitive peoples who live amid the most lovely
scenery have little or no perception of it. But
there are places and scenes where nature seems
to have performed a sort of process of abstraction
for us. The elements are simplified and
harmonious, and there is little to distract the
attention from certain main features. A com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>paratively
large number of people will have a
sufficiently developed spirit to get into touch
with something beyond the mere object at such
places. More education in abstraction and intuition
is required to perceive some kinds of
beauty; we see the same thing even in the artistic
creation of men. Mendelssohn appeals to far
more than Bach; Leader to far more than
Botticelli. Moreover, the more obvious kinds
of natural beauty, as we may loosely term them,
will appeal to many lesser artists, who will give
technical expression to them. We shall be thus
familiarised with these representations, through
pianolas and art-magazines and penny readings,
or through concerts and picture galleries and
study; and shall be the more prepared to intuit
for ourselves when we meet with objective
elements of a somewhat similar type. And we
have further argued that even in natural beauty
we are really following the intuition of Creative
Mind.</p>

<p>One other point is perhaps worthy of remark.
Natural science appears to compass a very large
achievement in knowledge, and to express this
knowledge with singular felicity; yet in science
there is little that can be called beautiful, except
in a highly metaphorical sense. The explanation
of this anomaly is clear and incontrovertible.
The work of theoretical science is essentially abstract,
and is concerned wholly with Appearance,
not Reality, except where it impinges upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
domain of philosophy. The intuition of Beauty
is an intuition of Reality.</p>

<p>We may now put down our conclusions in a
brief and more regular form:</p>

<p>(1) External things are required to rouse in
me a sense of beauty, but they are not in themselves
beautiful.</p>

<p>(2) I create their beauty, by understanding
them as parts of a Whole which is Reality.</p>

<p>(3) Beauty is expression; I must therefore
form a clear intuition and express it to myself.
This is my creative act; to which I may, or may
not, give a technical embodiment.</p>

<p>(4) But I am not merely creating a photographic
image, an imitation. I am getting into
a certain receptive condition in which I can
abstract from what I see its essence and fit this
into my knowledge of Reality. I cannot see a
thing as beautiful unless in some degree it gives
me this impression of relatedness to Reality and
to myself&mdash;linking me with the Reality of which
I am a part. Beauty thus comes to be a felt
relationship. My creation is the creation of a
fuller understanding of relatedness.</p>

<p>(5) I am always dissatisfied with Beauty,
which wakes in me a sense of longing exactly
the same as the longing of an unreciprocated
love. I receive and cannot give. Yet in this
beauty and this love there is joy as well as
sorrow.</p>

<p>(6) My life is part of an organic Whole whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
ultimate meaning and purpose is personal relationship&mdash;interpenetration.
The dissatisfaction is
due to a sense of imperfect interpenetration.
What is needed, and is felt to be needed, is equal
give and take&mdash;reciprocal creative activity. Dissatisfaction
comes when giving and taking are
not balanced.</p>

<p>(7) Beauty is eternal, since the creative expression
of Love is eternal, and Love knows
eternally what it is&mdash;is eternally self-conscious.
Love is relation, beauty the expression of the
immediate knowledge of that relation.</p>

<p>(8) This knowledge is always a new, creative
act. God must continually express His Being as
Love else He would cease to be Love and so to be
at all. In Creative Expression He renews Himself.
He is for Himself ever new. And, because
Love is centrifugal as well as centripetal, He
must for ever express Himself <i>outwards</i>, so to
speak, in the creation of other beings, and this
His work of self-abnegation is new and beautiful.</p>

<p>(9) We have hardly touched on the problem
of the ugly. We have little to add to Croce’s
explanation of it as the failure of expression&mdash;as
the failure to express coherent unity&mdash;which
involves the failure of intuition. We shall just
touch upon it hereafter; at the moment all we
need do is to remind ourselves that the ugliest
thing in the world is sin, because it is the failure
to understand the whole, and to express the
fullest, greatest beauty.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_II" id="PART_II">PART II</a><br />
BEAUTY IN EVOLUTION</h2>


<p>Theories of aesthetic, so far, have paid little
attention to the development of the sense
of beauty, except perhaps in the individual. This
was natural enough so long as the idea of evolution
was unformulated, or, if touched upon
speculatively, played little part in men’s general
attitude to life; and since the doctrine of evolution
came to its own, little original work, beyond
that of Croce, has been done in this region.
Croce touches the evolutionary aspect but lightly,
though it is implicit in his identification of
History with Philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Since all the characteristics assigned to Philosophy are
verbal variants of its unique character, which is the pure
concept, so all the characteristics of History can be reduced
to the definition and identification of History with the
individual judgment<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.” “If History is impossible without
the logical, that is, the philosophical, element, philosophy
is not possible without the intuitive, or historical element<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.”
“Philosophy, then, is neither beyond, nor at the beginning,
nor at the end of history, nor is it achieved in a moment or
in any single moment of history. It is achieved <i>at every
moment</i> and is always completely united to facts and conditioned
by historical knowledge.&mdash;The <i>a priori</i> synthesis,
which is the reality of the individual judgment and of the
definition, is also the reality of philosophy and of history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
It is the formula of thought which by constituting itself
qualifies intuition and constitutes history. History does not
precede philosophy, nor philosophy history; both are born
at one birth<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This view, however interesting and suggestive it
may be in the realm of pure thought, for the
simple reason that it does not boldly grapple
with the fact of <i>practical</i> dualism, is difficult of
application to the process of the dawn of consciousness.
Croce’s whole philosophy is directed
to the denial of dualism; it is a new form of
idealistic monism. We have been led in our
earlier reasonings to deny an ultimate dualism<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>,
but we have also been led to affirm dualism as
existent in Time, through the self-limitation and
immanence of Eternal Spirit. On this basis, at
which we arrived through a detailed consideration
of the process of inorganic and organic
evolution, we reared our whole superstructure.
On this same basis, then, we will attempt to
reason out a view of the evolution of beauty that
shall be in harmony both with the facts of
evolution and with the theocentric system that
issued from our discussion as apparently the
only possible explanation of the universe, so far,
at least, as its broad outline was concerned.</p>

<p>If beauty be the expression of an intuition,
and if, further, the intuition required involves a
sense of relation, there can be no true perception
of beauty until self-consciousness arises. Broadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
speaking, this is to say there can be no sense of
beauty except in man.</p>

<p>But here at once we are brought up against
the fact of sexual selection. Surely the posturings
of spiders, the dance of the ruff, the display of
the peacock and the Bird of Paradise, the song
of the warbler (if indeed this be a courting and
hymeneal song) do imply some aesthetic preference
in the mate? Still more does the
elaborate performance of the Bower-bird, with
its love-chase through the gay parterres of its
carefully decked garden and in and out of the
double-doored bower, suggest some sense of
beauty.</p>

<p>This fact, which at first sight seems fatal to
our whole theory, really supplies us with the
clue we lacked.</p>

<p>Perhaps, even at this moment of courting,
there is no true self-consciousness. Our previous
discussions have led us to question whether this
exists at all in animals, except possibly in a few
of those most developed through contact with
man. But there is unquestionably a sense of
relation. The male and female are urged to love-play
by the sexual impulse, and this necessarily
involves a sense of inter-relatedness. It may not
be&mdash;probably is not&mdash;sufficiently conscious of
the self and the other to be termed love. It is
a mere sense of the necessity of the other for
fulfilling a need as urgent and as little understood
as hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the sex-impulse we find a beginning of
the fact of inter-relation; and this is the foundation
we require. The elaborate instances we have
mentioned go a step farther than the simple sex-need.
There is a definite attempt to make that
need reciprocal by stimulating the dormant
sense of relation in the mate through the use of
objects to which a <i>meaning</i> is given through
emphasis or through arrangement and juxtaposition.
And this meaning is recognised, though
perhaps not as beauty exactly; that would imply
the expression of the meaning to the self, and it
is doubtful if the self yet exists. But it is very
hard to draw any line. At all events we can say
that here there is relation&mdash;and <i>self-conscious</i>
relation is love; and that here is expression of a
meaning and a need&mdash;and a <i>recognised</i> meaning,
or intuition, when expressed to the self is beauty.
We are on the confines of aesthetic. Now at first
sight this idea may raise a feeling of antagonism,
almost of disgust. We seem to have reduced
beauty to terms of the sexual impulse. Further
consideration will serve to dispel this sense of
a derogation of beauty, and will even give to
the sex-impulse itself a nobler significance,
making it appear as the first stage in the emergence
of Love and Beauty; rendering to it the
honour due from an understanding of the end
which it subserves. There can be little doubt
that in man the perception of beauty in the
opposite sex&mdash;not <i>as</i> beauty perhaps, but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
simple attraction to a beautiful person&mdash;does
very generally precede that of more impersonal
forms of beauty. Amid savage races this is unquestionably
the case. The strange decoration of
the body and other rites in the initiation of the
adolescent, are undoubtedly expressions connected
with sex-relations. To us they are ugly
because they fail to express our fuller understanding;
to the savage they are beautiful. And
I believe that in the children of a highly developed
artistic race it is true also in some measure. The
love-admiration of boys and girls begins at a very
tender age; and the psychoanalytic work of
Freud and Jung gives a significance, no doubt
often exaggerated, to acts and thoughts and
dreams of children which, if not strictly sexual
in the common sense, are yet connected with
the impulse&mdash;called by Jung the <i>libido</i>&mdash;that
underlies the evolution of the race. If we employ
the terminology of Bergson and Driesch, we may
say that the <i>élan vital</i>, or <i>entelechy</i>, is the <i>libido</i>
of Jung; that, as the animal progresses along the
path of evolution, it becomes the sexual impulse
in the wider sense given to the term by Freud;
and that in one aspect it finally becomes the
sexual impulse in the sense in which the term
is commonly understood, while it achieves infinitely
higher levels in the direction of spiritual
progress at the same time. But observe what this
implies. We have just noticed the obvious fact
that the sex-impulse involves a sense of relation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
It is probable that the first dawnings of relationship,
albeit in a primitive, almost sensational
form, arise here. The using of inanimate objects
as tools is probably evolved later than conjugation,
even in the protozoa. <i>Difflugia</i> may make
use of grains of sand to form its test, but all protozoa
conjugate. Anyhow, this is a minor matter.
The important point is that in the sex-impulse
arises first the sense of a relation between
individuals, which is destined, far later, to grow
into the first stages of love; and in the development
of the child we find traces of this origin,
distorted and chronologically misplaced, exactly
as one would expect from the Law of Recapitulation.</p>

<p>Another point of interest arises here. Many
psychoanalysts, and notably Jung<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, have shown
that mythology has an overwhelmingly sexual
content. Further, Rivers<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, and others, have
extended the conception of the primitive, or
infantile, character of myth in relation to the
primitive or infantile character of dreams,
showing that both belong to a lower level of
culture than does the waking self. As time goes
on more and more, not only of the minor
activities of the individual, but of the earlier
activities of the race, are relegated to the unconscious.
Psychologists have long recognised
this fact in dealing with habit-formation, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
these recent writers have given it a deeper
significance. The spirit uses the past as something
on which to build the future. In old days,
and among primitive peoples still to-day, the
explanation of life was sought in a very childish
manner. The impulse of sex was not understood,
its relation to procreation was largely hidden, as
witness the ceremonies of Intichiuma, and many
others that, by symbolic magic, should confer
fertility. It was mysterious, yet immensely
powerful. It had some sort of relation to the
birth of children and animals. The creation of
all things was mysterious, but since the new was
born these two mysteries must be connected.
Hence the sexual symbolism of myths that were
predominantly aetiological in character&mdash;that
were predominantly attempts to answer the
great Why? of the universe.</p>

<p>In the present connection, then, the chief
interest of the work of Freud and Jung on
infantile phenomena associated with sex, in so
far as it is not exaggerated, lies in the fact that
here too we have an instance of the working of
von Baer’s Law of Recapitulation. In the animal
the sense of relation begins with sex; in the child
we have strange, fragmentary primitive sex-phenomena
(if these psychoanalysts be right),
dissociated from many of their natural concomitants;
phenomena suggesting some close
analogy with the temporary appearance in the
embryo of structures that disappear again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
having lost their significance. Can it be that
the purely animal basis on which man’s great
structure of relationship is raised, is merely a
foundation, becoming gradually hidden, covered
up?</p>

<p>Love is, no doubt, in origin an impulse of sex.
Yet the highest love we know and experience in
ourselves has nothing sexual in it. When a man
and a maid fall in love there is no thought of
such things in the mind of either. Primarily,
true love is utterly pure from admixture with
animal instincts, though it may be, and is,
founded on them in the evolutionary sense, and
though they still play a vastly important part,
made beautiful by the love they subserve. But
the love that <i>begins</i> as conscious sex-instinct is
no love at all. There is love between men and
women, even young men and women, as well as
between those of the same sex, that is either
utterly free from all sexual content, or in which
that content is so trivial in amount, and so completely
dismissed from attention, that it is
practically non-existent. If one is conscious of
it at any moment, one is so by a definite effort
of the mind, and for the specific purpose of
bringing before oneself the wonderful emergence
of the purest and highest activity of the spirit
from so lowly and physical an origin. Such love
is far higher than the love between husband and
wife often is, where the sexual side is primary
as well as primitive, and friendship secondary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Only when husband and wife are first friends,
and then, after that, live together with a full
realisation of the sacramental meaning of sex as
the foundation on which the eternal temple of
love has been and is being built, can their union
approach the highest level. Then it is indeed the
best of all in this life. It takes them closer to the
heart of things than mere friendship would, and
enables them to make their other friendships
perfect through the understanding which it
brings. The physical subserves the spiritual, and
even in the physical the two are united. The
physical and the spiritual are for them one&mdash;parts
of a whole. Their own friendship is perfect
as far as anything human can be perfect, and
by it their friendships with others are made
perfect.</p>

<p>We see, then, in the founding and development
of the sexual impulse the first movement
of the <i>élan vital</i> along its true path of evolution.
The <i>élan vital</i> determines progress; it is the
unrest, the divine discontent of spirit creating
itself in matter<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. It progresses along various
roads, but the road that leads it to its own fulfilment
lies through sex. The <i>élan vital</i> becomes
<i>libido</i> in an even narrower sense than that,
almost co-extensive with Bergson’s term, which
Jung gives to the word. For through sex the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
sense of individual, and subsequently personal,
inter-relationship comes into being<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. With the
arousing of self-consciousness we find the dawn
of love. This is the beginning of understanding.
In the intuition of love is born the knowledge of
Reality. Faint, partial, obscured by the sex-basis
on which it is built up, it is yet the key to
the mystery of being. Gradually, slowly, amid
disappointing foulness and blind passion, it still
grows. In its insistence on relationship it is
manifested as the human aspect of religion. Side
by side with it grows the knowledge and love of
God. This is the divine aspect of religion, and
the two together make the world and the activity
of the spirit an intelligible whole. The “What is
Truth” of jesting Pilate finds here its answer.
All truth, all life, all process, in short Reality
itself, is known in the knowledge of the creative
love which is the activity of spirit. We see sex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
growing to greater and greater importance until
we reach man. Then self-consciousness intervenes;
the ideas of relation and of fellowship
dawn; love finds a beginning, and then sex begins
to lose its privileged place. From pre-eminence
it sinks to a secondary position. Its spiritual
part is nearly played, and something higher
carries on the work. Love is more than passion.
Sex must continue to function, for man has
still a physical body; but its spiritual significance
is understood, and that is a thing far greater than
itself. As love grows, passion sinks and sinks
from its first prominence, till love is all. “They
neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are
as the angels.” If this means anything at all, it
means that in the end the physical body will
have played its noble part and pass away, with
its passions and its failures; while the life goes
on, revealed in a body spiritual.</p>

<p>In the light of this understanding nothing is
left unclean. Even in the work of Freud, in so
far as it is true, and not coloured by the overstrained
interpretations of a pathologist, there is
nothing to shock, though much to sadden us.
Where in man there is over-emphasis of sex
there is a return to the lower, animal stage. Men
are regarding life in terms of what has been, and
not of what shall be. They are falling short of
their own possibilities. In what degree this
phenomenon is pathological, due to some neurosis
or psychosis, we may not judge them; in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
degree their over-concentration on animal passion,
to the exclusion of true spiritual activity,
is under the control of the will we are in presence
of sin. For, from the evolutionary point of
view, sin is the refusal to live up to the standard
that is at present possible, the acquiescence in a
standard that belongs properly to a stage outgrown;
lower; more animal, less divine. It is
content with an anachronism; the willing acceptance,
the welcome of failure to progress&mdash;and
this means <i>refusal</i> to progress<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>But to see in the sex-impulse the <i>explanation</i>
of love is to fall into the same error as do the
materialists, though the error has assumed a
new and more subtle guise. You can no more
explain love by sex than you can explain mind
by matter. In both cases you are using terms
to which you can attach no meaning. Ultimately
I cannot think of matter and yet exclude mind;
I cannot think of sex and yet exclude relation,
and so, ultimately, love. For scientific purposes
no doubt I can do both, for science is a process
of abstraction in which we disregard everything
that is not relevant to an immediate and narrow
purpose. But philosophy may not abstract. She
deals with the concrete and the real.</p>

<p>We have apparently lost sight of the question
of beauty; but those who have followed the
thought of the first chapter will realise that we
have not in fact gone far afield. Upon the founda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>tion
of sex, as we have seen, the sexless activity
of love is being slowly reared; and love is
relation&mdash;relation is the reciprocal, creative
activity which is spirit, and spirit is Reality. God
is Love; men perfected are, or will be, love. The
being of God and men alike is the activity of
personal relationship, made perfect in union
while yet each retains his self-identity<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. The
knowledge of this relation, the expression of it,
is Beauty; and in Beauty the whole theoretic
activity is comprehended in the ultimate resort,
when intuition, the immediate contact, and logic,
the mediate contact, are made one through
perfect knowledge.</p>

<p>Since then, the first origin of the realisation of
relationship is born in the sex-impulse, here the
beginnings of beauty must be sought. But to
search for them in any developed form&mdash;to
search for what we understand by beauty&mdash;in
the animal consciousness is vain. There can
exist in it only some dim fore-shadowing, some
preference. Not until true self-consciousness
arises can there be any real sense of beauty, if
beauty be the intuition of a relation expressed to
the self and to others. And arguing from the
psychological effect of beauty upon ourselves&mdash;the
longing it produces, and the creative impulse&mdash;we
have been driven to define beauty
as the expression of a relation. The germ from
which love and beauty will spring is already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
there in the relation between animals, but who
would guess that from the least of seeds should
be born so great and noble a tree?</p>

<p>Many have sought the origin of the sense of
beauty in the attraction of sex, and have then
hanged Beauty under this bad name. To do this
is to proclaim oneself a materialist. Our idea is
far different. Reasoning from the standpoint to
which we are driven by an examination of
evolution that does not neglect the phenomenon
of personality; finding the only explanation of
evolution itself in free personal relationship; we
see in sex the primitive ground-work of that
relationship. Physically, the sex relation subserves
many purposes; it provides a chief mode
of introducing variation, it blindly helps on the
evolutionary process through selective mating,
it provides the chemical stimulus to the development
of a new organism from the gamete or sex
cell. But it does more. In the light of the end
we see in sex a far nobler function; of a significance
not transient but abiding. In the great
adventure of Creative Love, to sex is given the
task of bringing about those relations which
constitute the ground-work of the personal
union which is Love. Of the understanding and
the expression of this relation is born the sense
of beauty, destined gradually to transfigure the
world for man, as he learns to see order and
purpose and significant relation in the whole, and
to endure eternal and yet always new.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></h2>


<p>Throughout this essay, in our quest for the
meaning of Beauty we have been driven to
reject the ground of the Natural as the proper
standpoint for viewing the Beautiful. Rather, in
Nature regarded from the point of view of
ultimate Reality, we have found a value only
through relation; and it is the intuition of this
relation, expressed to conscious mind, that constitutes
Beauty. No relation is, however, satisfying
but one which is mutual. There is beauty
in all expressed relations, even those of mathematics
and physics, but because these relations
are primarily expressed for the purpose of the
science as between thing and thing, and their
relation to the perceiving mind is relegated to
the background, the sense of beauty is not
roused in any great degree. By scenery a far
more vivid sense of beauty is kindled, and hand
in hand with this goes a keener sense of dissatisfaction
and creative longing. By pictures
and the like we are brought into touch with the
mind of the artist; he has felt a relation and given
to it technical expression, and we follow anew
his creative intuition. In doing so we get in
some degree into relation with his mind as well
as with the thing in which he saw beauty; and
we derive additional joy from this personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
relation, mediate though it be. But still there is
dissatisfaction, as well as creative desire. This
longing is identical with the longing of one-sided
love. We receive and cannot give. Only in perfectly
reciprocal love is the longing absent, while
yet the creative aspect is most vividly present.</p>

<p>The study of Philosophy irradiates the world
for us, increasing our sense of the beauty that
is in it. We understand more; the world’s relation
to us is more real, deeper, wider. Religion
has the same effect, though in so far as it sometimes
belittles the world it tends also to deaden
our understanding of the world’s beauty. But
if our philosophy coincides with our religion and
our scientific theory is a part of both, Beauty has
a chance of winning her proper position. If this
philosophy and this religion find their ultimate
Reality in the personal relationship we call love;
if in their ‘science’ the creative process of that
love’s activity in self-limitation stands revealed;
Beauty indeed comes to her own. In our intuition
of the world’s beauty we are in touch
with the creative idea of the Master Mind. Only
a philosophy and a religion that are rooted and
grounded in the God who is Love, yet take the
fullest account of the time-processes of love
which we call evolution, can reveal the fulness
of Beauty. Then Beauty is seen as Spirit’s grasp
upon the relation between all the parts of the
whole&mdash;a relation that is not yet complete, and
can only be complete when the sole relation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
that of love between personal beings, of whom
God is the first in timeless Being. Then, when
matter is seen as the expression of God’s self-limitation
for the sake of His people’s freedom,
realisation dawns that matter is instinct with
beauty for the understanding mind. Aesthetic
becomes the link that binds all our theoretic
knowledge together, making it one&mdash;serviceable
as an equal partner with the practical activity.
In this partnership the activity of the spirit is
perfected<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. The beauty of relationship is always
new, just as love is always new. Our creation
is our expression of our personal being in
relationship, which is ultimately love. God’s
creation is the expression of His Personal Being
in relationship. Without relationship He would
not be personal; but more is implied in this
statement than merely internal relations. Personality,
the δύναμις of κοινωνία, is centrifugally
creative, as we have seen elsewhere, and the
thing created, because it is a relationship, is
beautiful, and is new. In the perennial newness
of beauty we find the key to God’s creative
activity. He creates new persons, because His
relation to them is new and beautiful. Just
because His experience is the experience of
Perfect Personality new things are perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
added. Without this activity His Being would
not be perfect. Its perfection is substantiated
by its power of finding beauty new. Only the
inactive dullard fails to see beauty and is bored,
and in his very dulness he loses the prerogative
of personality.</p>

<p>From the height of such a conception,
standing upon ultimate Reality, we have looked
down upon the humble beginnings of the
intuition of relation, or of beauty. These we
found pre-eminently in sex, and so far we were
in accord with the psychoanalytic schools of
Vienna and of Zurich. But we saw sex transformed
and made beautiful, because our eyes
were fixed, not on low, immediate purposes,
but on the wonderful things that were to come.
Mainly out of the relationship of sex spring
music, art, literature&mdash;all the beauty that is so
far removed from its physical origin&mdash;and it is
in these things of eternal value that we find the
true purpose of sex, as opposed to its immediate
physical meaning. In music, art, literature we
see the expression of growing understanding.
The Reality is brought nearer and nearer to man.</p>

<p>Could Philosophy but bring our thought in
closer contact with Aesthetic, as Croce has nobly
endeavoured to bring it, understanding would
quicken marvellously. Could religion embrace
the arts and use them, the world would move
Godward with fresh inspiration; the arts themselves
would be enriched, coming into their true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
heritage. Croce has paved the way to understanding,
but he missed the goal because he
did not perceive that the content of Reality
is relationship. This essay attempts to indicate
how much is lost by his omission. God
is Love; Reality is Love. Love is relationship.
Beauty is the expression of our understanding
of that relationship. The Good, the True, the
Beautiful are seen as different aspects of the
same Reality; each definable only in terms of
another; each involving, and indeed being,
the same system of relations seen from a
different angle. Goodness is the relation of
spirit to spirit, Truth the relation of part to part
and part to whole, Beauty the expression of the
spirit’s knowledge of the relations that make
up Reality. Our understanding of these relations&mdash;yes,
and God’s understanding&mdash;is perpetually
creative, and its creation is a new thing for
Perfect Being; for the Perfection of Being is
only substantiated by its power to create the
new, the beautiful, the related. Matter is
beautiful because it is understood as the expression
of the infinite activity of the spirit of love.
As Personal Being is the one thing that lasts
beyond Time, and carries in itself the character
of absoluteness, so it appears that Beauty, the
knowledge and expression of the relationship of
Personal Being, is also eternal. Beauty can never
cease, for it is a necessary part of God’s experience
and ours.</p>

ART FORMS IN DEVELOPMENT</h2>


<p>Although any detailed treatment of the concrete forms
of art is entirely foreign to the intention of this essay,
it is desirable that we should devote a little consideration to
the way in which these technical expressions arise and to
the psychological effects they produce. In doing this we
shall refer to the work of various artists, but only for purposes
of illustration. The part of the art critic is as unnecessary
to our purpose as it is beyond our powers.</p>

<p>To omit all reference to concrete matters seemed undesirable,
as leaving the theory rather in the air. On the
other hand any detailed discussion of the theory as applied
to the development of concrete art-forms must necessarily
introduce debatable propositions, and must be tentative. It
therefore seemed desirable to relegate the discussion of
concrete matters to an Appendix, and to state clearly that
what was there said was meant rather to suggest ideas than
to lay down definite principles. Applications that may be
open to question do not invalidate a theory, while they do
make for clear understanding of it.</p>

<p>The question whether beauty itself is a universal or a
particular has already found implicit answer. Since beauty
is the expression of a relation that is understood as an
essential determination of Reality, the concept of beauty is a
pure concept. It is expressive, it is concrete, it is universal.
It is clearly expressed to the self as a cognitive product,
expressible in words (definition) and symbols (technique).
It answers to Croce’s test that though “universal and
transcendent in relation to the single representation, it is
yet immanent in the single, and therefore in all representations,”
and is therefore concrete. It also transcends the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
single representations, “so that no single representation, and
no number of them can be equivalent to the concept” and so
is universal.</p>

<p>But the foundation of every universal concept exists in
an intuition of the particular. The intuition and its expression
to the self come first, then follows the extension of the
theoretic activity in logic. The concept of beauty must, then,
have arisen, and at every fresh realisation must still arise,
like all concepts, from an intuition of Reality as existent in
a particular; and we must therefore seek its origin in specific
individual cases.</p>

<p>Now we have argued that beauty is most probably
associated initially with sex, since with sex the idea of
personal relationship first arises. Our main thesis would
not however be invalidated if it could be shown that a
vague intuition of relation with inorganic or non-personal
objects arose first. The intuition of relation may well have
several separate starting points. Only, in this case, the
reciprocal element would be absent (though its lack might
not be felt except as a vague dissatisfaction) and could only
arise when the sex-relation was the subject of a similar
intuition. But most likely the intuition of relation did arise
with sex, and, since our argument is concerned to show
that ultimately the intuition of beauty leads to the expression
of mutual relationship&mdash;love&mdash;and finds there the explanation
both of its peculiar quality, and of the creative longing it
produces, we will confine our argument mainly to this aspect.</p>

<p>Now if this be so, the sense of beauty is likely to be
associated in its earliest stages with sight, and only in a
secondary degree with sound, in the mating-call and in the
beginnings of language. This is borne out by the fact that
music usually lags behind, and is more primitive in expression
than the visual arts&mdash;personal ornamentation and even
decoration of objects. True, the first formal <i>expression</i> is
likely to be in sound&mdash;in the beginnings of language. The
dynamic relation between persons maybe accompanied and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
expressed throughout by speech. But at this primitive level
it will be a very limited intuition or understanding that is
expressed, and moreover, an intuition that is based on
visual stimuli. We may therefore leave the question of
language for the present. Its importance in the earlier
stages is mainly practical. Through sight (when the stage of
simple chemiotaxis is passed) arises the perception of
desirability in the opposite sex<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, which is the animal starting-point
from which love is evolved. This desirability and
this relation are expressed to the self, and this expression
is beauty in its humblest beginning. Then, later, the
creative aspect enters into consciousness. At first it was
satisfied, unconsciously, in mating; but soon this unconscious
satisfaction is felt to be inadequate. The representative
process begins.</p>

<p>Now here we find a difficulty. According to our theory,
the earliest attempts at the pictorial art should be pictures
of men and women, but this is not, I believe, the case<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
We must, however, remember that the idea of symbolic
magic arises very early. This is natural. The representation
of a thing is that thing in some degree. You have power
over your representations, therefore you have power over
the thing. The use of such power has an anti-social aspect,
which forbids its common or public use except in the form,
of a magico-religious ceremony. It is unlikely, therefore,
that if such representations were made, they should have
come down to us. Moreover, it is unnecessary that the
magic object should bear any superficial resemblance to the
thing it symbolises; indeed it is undesirable that it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
be recognisable by others, since the practice for which it is
destined is nefarious and illicit. An esoteric significance is
enough. There is a very close connection between primitive
art and religion. Thus the Palaeolithic drawings of animals
in the dark caves of Périgord and Altamira, are undoubtedly
connected with magico-religious ceremonies to give power
over the beasts. For this reason then&mdash;the acquiring of a
<i>prise</i> over the object represented&mdash;we should hardly expect
to find many early drawings of men and women, other than
divinities. Even to-day many savages evince the greatest
fear of having their likeness drawn. Nevertheless, these
Neolithic drawings do exist, proving that there was no
universal tabu on such representations. Moreover such
drawings as those of the Bushmen show that primitive art
at times uses drawings to record historical events, such as
raids by other tribes. The comparative scarcity of primitive
drawings is, however, easily explicable when we take the
fact of magical beliefs into account. And there are sufficiently
numerous examples of drawings of animals&mdash;bear, rhinoceros,
lion, mammoth, bison, reindeer, to show that prehistoric
man did have an intuition of his relation to other
creatures. Furthermore, since the creative impulse does
receive some, if unconscious, satisfaction in sex-relationship,
expressed in word and action, there is the less need for
technical expression in the early stages. We find at all events
enough prehistoric drawings to show the recognition of
relation, and the expressive activity, and these are the
desiderata for an aesthetic fact.</p>

<p>Leaving the most primitive level, we find the development
of decoration. Pottery is shaped with some regard to
form and symmetry, and simple ornament of a geometric
character makes its appearance<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. Much might be said on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
this subject, but we will confine ourselves to a few fundamental
considerations.</p>

<p>In the first place we notice that here man’s art is practically
unfettered by religious and magical inhibitions. Geometric
forms do not generally represent any person or power<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.
Artistic creation therefore can move freely. Next, we observe
that the art is reaching a higher level, and that consciously.
There is conscious elimination and abstraction at work in
the construction of patterns made of simple lines and
curves. We find also the rudiments of an endeavour to find
a harmony and rhythm that may give a sense of satisfied
understanding. Men are beginning to feel the need of unity
and harmony and order, and in so far as geometric ornament
gives the feeling of these and of purpose, it is beautiful, for
it expresses their intuition of an ordered reality.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for us to discuss the intrinsic beauty of
curves, or the mental satisfaction afforded by the golden
section. The Greeks, and later writers such as Fechner,
have expended much ingenuity in doing this. But their
conclusions amounted to little more than that the aesthetic
pleasure given by geometric form was due to the sense of
symmetry and order and unity that were brought about by
elaborate differentiation of detail subordinated to a single
idea. As we have just said, Geometric ornament expresses
man’s intuition of an ordered relation and interdependence
in Reality.</p>

<p>We have introduced the ideas of elimination and abstraction.
These are present in all artistic representation, and
probably in all artistic perception. Because the power is
rare in any high degree of development, artistic genius is
rare. Moreover it frequently happens in ordinary people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that the perception of beauty is first aroused consciously
by pictures rather than by natural scenes. A flower is
simple enough for a child to understand, and we find that
in many children, especially artistic ones, the perception
of beauty is first awakened by flowers. The elements of a
sunset, or a moonlight scene with clear tones and silhouetted
outlines, are simple enough for the untrained mind to
appreciate. But it requires an artistic genius to see the
beauty of a complex landscape. In representing this
technically he simplifies, emphasises, eliminates and
abstracts. The man who looks at his picture follows the
creative process of his mind, and, the elimination being
already done for him, is able to appreciate. Moreover he
receives training in the process, and is the more ready to
eliminate for himself; to appreciate natural beauty of a
complex order. Even if our artistic development is not
high, we love pictures because in looking at them and
understanding them we perform a creative act ourselves;
but it is the artist who has made it possible for us to perform
the act by his simplification of the problem. Browning
clearly understood this, for he wrote:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We’re made so that we love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, when we see them painted, things we have passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sometimes the artist achieves his emphasis by means not
wholly agreeable to the medium which he is using. Many
artists of great technical ability link human sympathies with
an admirably interpretative <i>mise-en-scène</i> which carries out
their vision. Nevertheless the picture that tells a story calls
in adventitious aid. It is like the illustrated reading book
of a child; by the child mind it is created, and to the child
mind it appeals. It cannot express a clear intuition by a
simple representation in a single medium, but uses two,
appealing not only in pictorial symbols, but in dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
as well, and the intuition itself is obscured by the process.
Owing to this confusion of media and of intuition the result
is unsatisfactory to minds more developed aesthetically, for
reasons that we shall adduce later, while yet the double
appeal makes the meaning more evident to the beginner.
Again certain landscape artists of the second rank by insistence
on simple elements of natural beauty, by emphasis,
and by elimination of distracting ideas, open a new vision
to minds hardly prepared yet for such intuition in face of
the natural object. Add to this the half conscious yet
acutely pleasurable process of following out the technical
means by which the artist has impressed his intuition upon
canvas, and we can understand the joy of looking at their
pictures.</p>

<p>But where the artist’s vision goes deeper, where the reality
is more clearly seen, and where in order to express this
intuition, to represent it, and to bring out its less obvious
harmony and order, a more sweeping process of elimination
and abstraction is needed, the simple mind is unable to
follow. Not everyone is at the stage to appreciate the subtle
symphonies of Whistler, the bare simplicity of D. Y.
Cameron, the rigorous certainty of Botticelli. The conventions
and purposeful line of an early Japanese print; the
vibrant light of the post-impressionist landscape artists; the
wilful, obtrusive, almost harsh insistence of the cubist that
you <i>shall</i> turn your mind away from curves that hitherto you
have deemed essential, in order to grasp other truths, not
only seem ugly&mdash;that is to say, meaningless&mdash;to the mind
whose artistic perception is little developed, but may even
distract it, in rebellious protest, from the truth the artist
wishes to proclaim, though others further advanced find
in some of their work a very high type of beauty. And, be it
added, the artist himself fails in his expression if he overdoes
the emphasis in such a way that his representation of
the Reality becomes lopsided and inharmonious, as is too
often the case. Further where he is not a creative artist at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
all, but a slavish imitator of a method not really his own,
we are presented with the meaningless monstrosities that
here and there defile the Salon des Indépendants&mdash;and
other less catholic exhibitions! In some, too, the animal
basis is the only intuition expressed, and art gobbles greedily
at its mess of pottage.</p>

<p>Yet as a whole we have moved a long way from the
animal expression of a need of its complementary animal.
The whole world is related to us, and in that relation we find
beauty. And beautiful as it is we find it very lovable, even
though we cannot but feel that our love can never be
satisfied since we can give nothing back.</p>

<p>Yet something we can give, though not to it&mdash;something
that makes things clearer. In our minds we can give to
this world a meaning, as itself subordinate, yet the necessary
means of our self-realisation, and we can share this meaning
with others. We find a meaning in life, and that meaning is
fellowship. We find a meaning in nature, and that meaning
dwells in the Creative Being of the God who is Love. Beauty,
more clearly day by day, becomes for us the expression of
Reality, and that Reality is the reciprocal relationship of
persons. Religion gives one pathway of approach, Beauty
another, but both join to form the highway of our God.
There is more than room for beauty in religion; there is
more than room for aesthetic in theology; there is an
absolute need, if they are not to be in a measure inexpressive,
lopsided, and therefore ugly. Our concept of Reality must
be symmetrical, or fail of adequacy.</p>

<p>What is true of pictorial art is equally true of other
forms. Style&mdash;the higher art of language&mdash;demands education
before it can be appreciated. In literature again, the
general public prefers Longfellow to Keats, <i>The Passing of
Arthur</i> to <i>A Death in the Desert</i>, Ella Wheeler Willcox to
the <i>Divina Commedia</i>. Henry James demands a more
intimate appreciation of the spirit of man than does Dickens.
In all these there is beauty&mdash;the expression of an intuition&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>but
those who see furthest and most clearly have the smallest
public. Most men cannot even follow where they lead, and
few indeed are the pioneers.</p>

<p>Before we leave the question of literature and language,
we may just glance at its development. This is comparatively
an easy matter to understand. The warning, the expression
of satisfaction, the mating-call are common among animals.
The powers of communication and of speech develop with
the development of self-consciousness. They are expressions
of the relation between the self and its ‘others,’ and
especially of the relation between the self and other selves.
They carry the germs of understanding, and as they lead
from the particular to the more general they bear in them
the quality of the beautiful. The relations between the self
and the other selves, and between the self and the environment,
become more and more universalised. In speech
they are communicated, but speech is transient. A more
permanent record is required, and here again resort is had
to symbolism, less generally intelligible, more esoteric, than
the pictorial symbol, since there is no one universal language;
the symbolism of written speech. Speech, however, is
episodic and dramatic. It moves along with the march of
events. So too with literature, for the most part. The Pictorial
and Plastic arts represent beauty as static; yet they are
not lifeless. Activity, movement, is implicit in them, while
yet the beauty they express is restful, and has in it something
of the quality of absoluteness and transcendence. Language,
literature, drama are dynamic. In them beauty moves;
immanent and unquiet at first sight; yet here too there is
something that expresses the eternal meaning. Purpose
moves to its fulfilment, and, while it moves, the end is in
view. Nevertheless in pictorial art the static side is the most
prominent, in linguistic the dynamic side. We may observe,
however, that in order to counteract the transitoriness of
purely episodic speech, recourse is had to visual symbolism
as well. The graphic art aims at perpetuating the episode,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and by doing so renders possible the development to which
we shall immediately draw attention.</p>

<p>Now the untrained mind appreciates the dynamic aspect
of literature, whether it be the originative mind or the mind
of the reader. This explains the output and the popularity of
the thrilling tale of adventure. At its lowest we find the
Penny Dreadful. Through Stanley Weyman and Dumas we
move towards Conrad and Meredith and Hardy, where the
dynamic element is thrillingly present (as present it must
be indeed even in the most quiet essays) but where it is
subordinated to a clear vision of the permanent and eternal
which we have mis-termed static. In poetry this truth is
obvious. Even in drama, though our attention is distracted
by the action, it is the chief quality if the drama is really
great. In Sophocles, in Euripides, in Shakespeare; perhaps
almost too consciously in Galsworthy, and Paul Claudel
and Synge, for conscious art loses the sincerity of a first
vision; it is not the episodic sequence that interests us,
except from the point of view of technique. Our attention
is focussed upon the motive, the fundamental intuition to
which the dramatist is trying to give technical expression.
Moreover in all the infinite variety of literary art the motive
is the same. One definite intuition is expressed&mdash;that of
relationship; relation between person and person, relation
between person and machine, relation between person and
some ever-ruling Order, be it Fate, Chance, or God also
personal. It is the reality of personal inter-relationship that
underlies all literature, be it love-poem, novel, or some drama
of Fate in which personal relationship is overshadowed by
the impersonal, or at least the unsympathetic; or else it is
the one-sided relation of a person to a thing, as in descriptive
science, which has only the beauty of order. But can we
say that the intuition which the pictorial artist represents
is the same as this? Hardly, unless the picture tells a story;
and in so far as it does this we feel that the realm of pictorial
art is invaded by an alien influence. It may at first sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
seem surprising that art should not gain by the introduction
of various intuitions of relation; that it does not, as a rule,
is certain. All the arts overlap; we shall see the most marked
example of this when we come to consider music and deal
further with this point; but intrinsically each is peculiar in
its scope and method.</p>

<p>Now it is worth while to observe that the longing aroused
by the beauty of literature is rather different from that
induced by pictures. It is less vague. Because literature
deals with the relation between persons our attention is
directed towards the persons we know&mdash;our longings and
aspirations reach out consciously towards them and towards
God. We think of particular people and our relation to
them. Our creative longing is directed towards them, in
active relation, or towards creative literary work of which,
more or less consciously to ourselves they are the background.
Moreover we always identify ourselves, in a greater
or less degree, with one or more of the protagonists of the
story; in them we suffer, we love, we adventure at second-hand.
This phenomenon of identification, closely allied as
it is to day-dreaming, has of late come much under the
attention of psychoanalysts under the title of phantasy;
a term covering all attempts to achieve through the imagination
the satisfaction denied to us in actual life. For our
present purpose this is only noteworthy as confirming the
truth of our observation that in literary creation, whether
at first or second hand, it is human relation&mdash;the relation of
ourselves and others&mdash;that lies behind our intuition and its
expression.</p>

<p>In some pictorial art this relation between persons, this
personal touch, does not obtain. In landscape the artist’s
intuition obviously deals with the relation of things to
men&mdash;a relation much more onesided. Correspondent to
this, we find our intuition and our longing far more vague,
far more dissatisfied. There needs a higher knowledge of
Reality to understand how man has relation to things. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
intuition of this relation is generally expressed with far
less understanding. Human relations may intrude, and we
get the story-picture and the problem-picture. Moral
relations may intrude, and we get the symbolic picture,
such as those of Watts and Blake. Drama, myth and legend
may intrude and we get the Ladies of Shallot, the Ledas,
and the Calumnies of Apelles.</p>

<p>But pictorial art reaches its highest plane in the religious
picture and the portrait. Have we not, here, the intrusion
of the story in the first case; and in the second have we not
the purely human relations between artist and sitter?</p>

<p>I think it is just to say that the religious picture is not
episodic. It represents what, for want of a better word, we
have termed a static intuition. In the greatest Madonnas,
even those of the beginning of the decadence, such as
Raphael’s, all the birth-pangs, all the pain, and all the
achievement of life at its highest go to make up the intuition
of the artist. I venture to think that in one picture at least,
the Madonna of the Magnificat, the artist even hints subtly
that he is expressing in an image the whole meaning of
the world, by distorting his figures and modifying his lights
as they would be distorted and modified when reflected in a
convex mirror. διὰ κάτοπτρον is for all art, but the fact is
not evident to him who only glances. The artist’s intuition
must be understood, by a mind that follows it creatively;
even if its creation be at times over-ingenious.</p>

<p>The religious picture, no doubt, could not have been
painted but for the historic episode which it represents.
But there is a strong presumption that it does not owe its
intuition to one episode, nor even to the whole history of
a life; though a Crucifixion, an Entombment, and indeed a
Madonna, would only be intelligible in their fulness to one
who knew the life of Christ. It is the relation of a whole
Life, Divine yet Human, to the life of each one of us that
lies at the bottom of the artist’s vision. Only a great
Christian can paint a great Madonna, however sin-stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
he may be. Magdalene, who loved much, could see deeper
than jesting Pilate, deeper than the self-righteous Pharisee.</p>

<p>There is here no intrusion of an alien element; a vision of
Reality is represented in one medium. The episode no doubt
is there, but it is incidental, and does not constitute the
vision. Episode is always there, even in a landscape; the
question is whether the appeal&mdash;the original intuition&mdash;is
episodic or universal. But no doubt the human relation is
emphasised; and in this respect we have moved far away
from landscape. The relation of man to inanimate nature is
however included and interpreted in the artist’s vision.
I think that the half-conscious perception of this lies behind
the frequent introduction of landscape in such pictures. It
may be said that these simply help to complete the composition,
but to say this is to beg the question. Why do they
complete the composition? Why do they satisfy us? Is it
not that they form an intrinsic part of the artist’s intuition;
that in the harmony of figures and landscape he symbolises,
and we after him, the universal harmony which he has seen?</p>

<p>In a portrait, too, we read not only the relation between
sitter and artist, which must be a relation of deep sympathy
and understanding if the portrait is to be anything but an
imitation, but also the relation of the sitter to all the events
of his life. Think of Raeburn’s portrait of James Wardrop.
The strength, the kindliness, the rugged purpose, the
humour with which the old man faced his life all through
are there. It is the face of a man who has fought and won, and
in fighting and winning has learned much wisdom. Think
of Giorgione’s Portrait of a Gentleman, with its wealth of
refinement; with its conviction that “manners makyth
man,” sustained with gentleness already many times when
courtesy and calm were not easy. Yet here too there is no
representation of episode. The painter’s art is faithful to
itself and allows no alien intrusion. The harmony, the
unity of a man’s life, compounded though that life be of
sequent episodes, makes the artist’s intuition. History has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
become philosophy. An absolute thing, an aspect of Reality,
is presented, and we feel somehow that it is not set against
the world but includes the world.</p>

<p>The same kind of thing may be said of lapidary art, and
we will not dwell on it in detail. The sculptor sees beauty
in the human or animal form and in three dimensional
representation generalises from it, whether his work represent
an individual or an ideal; for the individual is used
to express an ideal, the ideal is localised in an individual.
The problem of the architect is somewhat different, being
on the theoretic side the attempt to portray in three
dimensions that which the designer of geometric patterns
expresses in two&mdash;rhythm and order; multiplicity that
establishes a unity; unity that interprets a multiplicity.
But here, more than in other arts, the practical has to be
kept in mind, and a harmony preserved between the
economic and the theoretic activities. Generally one or
other predominates, no one clear idea is expressed, and in
consequence, much modern architecture, especially domestic
and civic architecture, is unpleasing. To build a house is
harder than to paint a picture, because men have to live in
a house; and in a contention between two ideas the artistic
side is overbalanced by the practical. Moreover the idea of
relationship is comparatively subordinate here just because
two ideas are set over against one another. The relationship
of a thing to a man is in view. The aim is primarily economic,
and beauty takes a second place because the intuition of
harmony is vague and its expression imperfect.</p>

<p>If, however, a house is built, as some Tudor and Georgian
houses were, with an eye to simple proportion which must
not be violated, but otherwise with the realisation that it
had to be lived in, and that it must be designed solely with
this end in view, the result is eminently pleasing. There is
no falsity, no attempt to mingle irreconcileables, no striving
after a beauty that cannot be achieved because it is without
meaning in such a connection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>We may now turn to music, in some ways the most
difficult of all. Beginning with the evolutionary aspect, as
with linguistic art we find its origin in the relation of beasts
to each other and to the world. The mating-call, the crooning
of passion and of satisfied well-being, the warning of danger,
the hunting call, the sound of the wind, the sea, the river,
the “going in the tops of the trees,” provide the ground-work
of both, expressing the relation of beast to beast, and
beast to thing. But, as we have seen, such calls, such sounds,
and the language to which they give rise, are episodic. The
sense of unity and endurance is lost. Just as, over against
the visual symbols of episode which constitute the beginnings
of literature we find the visual symbols of unity and static
endurance which characterise pictorial art, so too we find
the auditory symbols of episode that make speech, and
the auditory symbols of unity that make music. We saw
that, to preserve the episode of speech, visual symbolism
is eventually called in. Even to-day the untrained reader
has to form the sound with his lips as he reads; for the more
expert the visual symbol definitely represents the sound:
the written symbols have their own timbre. So too with
music. To preserve the unity from being lost, it comes at
last to be symbolised visually, and there are many who can
hear the music as they read the score. Both the letter on
the page and the notes on the stave are symbols of the
second degree&mdash;symbols of symbols&mdash;for what they
symbolise is in itself the symbol of the artist’s intuition of
a unity in multiplicity. This in parenthesis.</p>

<p>We have said that in purely episodic sound such as the
danger-call and the mating-call the sense of unity is absent.
Doubtless no call is really and wholly episodic, in man at
any rate, but it cannot be questioned that the episode is
predominant. The sense of relation is transient; the
economic need is all important.</p>

<p>But the theoretic activity cannot be left out of account
for long. The man of to-day, when he feels his whole being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in harmony, his body tingling from the cold bath, sings
lustily. When we are well and cheerful we sing. So too
when a bird is well and cheerful, with all his bodily needs
satisfied or soon to be satisfied&mdash;so readily satisfied as to be
themselves a pleasure of anticipation&mdash;he sings. No doubt
the cave-mother sang to her baby in quiet murmurs; no
doubt the cave-father hummed as he lolled in the cave-mouth
after dinner, idly binding an arrow-head upon the
shaft. Somehow, in a rhythmic sequence of sound the
satisfaction of a body in harmonious rhythm with itself
and its surroundings is expressed. Then, we may imagine,
the singer becomes aware of his song, and begins to think
about it. The beauty of the song as a whole, the beauty of a
sequence in sound that makes a unity, is consciously perceived,
and a new art dawns. It is an art very similar to that
of the designer of geometric patterns. Unity is established
through infinite multiplicity of details, in forming no one of
which is the unity forgotten. The music mirrors an intuition
of harmony in a Reality that owes its unity to its multiplicity
and its multiplicity to its unity; a Reality that is based on
relationship of parts.</p>

<p>In music, then, we find rhythm, order, sequence. It is
both episodic and static, though episode and unity are in
symbolic form. In the individual sequences, the internal
multiplicity, the episode is given; in the whole, the unity
of Reality, the static, or better, the absolute element.</p>

<p>Because in good music these two aspects must of necessity
be perfectly balanced, music can rouse the keenest, highest
sense of beauty in a greater degree than any other of the arts.</p>

<p>But often music falls short of this. Mendelssohn for
instance, too often sacrifices everything to prettiness. The
individual sequences are trivial and empty. Multiplicity of
episode is lost sight of in a rather petty unity; the two are
not balanced. The fourth sound is simply a fourth note,
not a star. Not only is the intuition limited, but the balance
is not preserved between the notes and the whole in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
expression. Bach owes his pre-eminence to the perfect
balance between attention to detailed sequence and expression
of a great intuition. Future musicians may see further
than he did, but unless they can achieve his perfect balance
they will fail to express what they see, and in so far as they
fail they will be rewarded with ugliness.</p>

<p>The music-hall tune has but a very paltry vision to
express; generally the relationship it portrays is one of
vulgar intrigue or animal desire, at best one of elementary
aspiration; and its notes have a purely subordinate and
utilitarian <i>rôle</i>. If it is pretty or ingenious it has got far
beyond the average. Generally, moreover, it is constrained
by considerations alien to music. The words are written, and
the tune has to illustrate them. In this it differs from folk-tunes,
where words and music grow together, each shaping,
moulding, modifying the other, till the song is one thing.</p>

<p>This brings us back to a question which we have several
times touched upon, and as often shelved&mdash;the question
of the overlapping of different arts. Opera, oratorio, and
ballet give us excellent examples, and from them we will
draw the material of our brief discussion.</p>

<p>In Opera we have drama, episode expressed in language,
set in a more or less accordant scene with histrionic
accompaniment, and woven in with a musical interpretation.
In Oratorio we have the same thing without the scenery
and the histrionics. In Ballet&mdash;and of this art the Russian
Ballet is especially in my mind&mdash;we have the drama, the
scene, the histrionic accompaniment in choregraphic form,
and the music.</p>

<p>Let us take Opera first. There are two appeals to the ear
and two to the eye. The music and the words; the acting and
the scenery. The scenery, if subdued and perfectly in accord
with the action, does not much distract the attention, for it
is purely a pictorial setting. Nevertheless a sense is growing
that in drama it ought to be so much subordinated that it
does not distract the attention at all, being confined to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
few patterns that help in our understanding of the motive,
or to simple draperies. As far as I am aware this has not
yet been attempted in opera<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, but opera is such a jumble of
incongruities that it can never be an artistic whole, much
as we may rejoice in individual parts of it. The words,
however, do constrain the music in a manner thoroughly
unjustifiable: “In composing an opera the stage should be
the musician’s first thought, he must not abuse the confidence
of the theatre-goer who comes to <i>see</i> as well as to
<i>hear</i>.... The stage often paralyses a composer’s inspiration,
that is why symphonic and chamber music are so far
superior to opera. A symphony or a sonata imposes no
limitations, but in opera, the first necessity is to speak the
musical language of the great public<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.” Moreover the action
and the music are so incompatible that we are forced to
leave our sense of humour outside the theatre door. When
the hero explains for ten minutes that the heroine is in
acute danger and that therefore he must hurry away; when
Tristan and Isolde sing their passion with complete detachment
for more than half an hour; we cannot feel that the
action helps the music or the music the action. In Oratorio,
since action is absent, we feel this particular incongruity
less, for we manage mentally to eliminate time; but few
will be found to defend the oratorio as a form of aesthetic
expression. It is the anthem prolonged into a “useless
Alexandrine,” “which like a wounded snake drags its slow
length along.” The fatal fact about opera and oratorio is
that the music is constrained to do something that is alien
to itself. It is interpretive of episode, and the episode
forces it into shape. It is not free. This is the root trouble
always when two arts overlap. Art must be completely free
to express its intuition technically, subject only to the
inevitable restrictions of the technique proper to it. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<i>these</i> restrictions it even gains, since the lines of simplification
are to some extent determined, and this very determination
helps the artist towards clear expression of a clear
intuition. It would, of course, be absurd to say that music
does not express definite intuitions that are expressible
through other media as well. “I do not in the least agree
with you that music cannot interpret the universal nature
of love,” writes Tchaikovsky to Nadejda von Meck. “On
the contrary, I think only music is capable of doing so.
You say words are necessary. O no! This is just where
words are not needed, and where they have no power; a
more eloquent language comes in, which is music. Look
at the poetical forms to which poets have recourse in order
to sing of love; they simply usurp the spheres which belong
inseparably to music. Words clothed in poetical forms cease
to be mere words; they become partly music<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.” But if there
is a restriction alien to the art and imposed from without,
which prevents full expression in that medium, the result
is bound to be more or less a failure. The dramatic episode
and the verbal form in opera constitute such a restriction,
introducing a vein of unreality that is fatal to aesthetic
expression. In oratorio, where the words demand a representation
they do not get, and where yet the music is bound
by the words, we feel the same thing. Even to take a poem
and set it to music is almost bound to lead to aesthetic
disappointment. The intuition of the artist is not single nor
free. The writer of the melody may recreate the intuition
of the poet, he may try to express the same intuition in his
setting, but the setting is none the less constrained by the
words. The musician is not at liberty to form one clear
intuition and give it free play<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. The form of the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
is already fixed in part, and the knowledge of this fixation
forms a second intuition which generally obscures and
confuses the main one. Moreover both expressions appeal
to the same sense, that of hearing, and this, apparently, produces
greater confusion, more lack of clarity, in the auditor.
The same fact accounts for the unsatisfactoriness of music
which moves out of its proper sphere and endeavours to tell
a definite story or paint a definite scene. The 1812 Overture,
fine though it is, can never be said to be pre-eminent as
music; nor can Haydn’s Creation, nor any of the music
that, intentionally or unintentionally, is not single-hearted,
but calls up visual images as well as depending on them. This
statement does not constitute an indictment of programme-music.
The <i>Adagio</i> of Beethoven’s Fourth Symphony cannot
be thus lightly dismissed<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. In Tchaikovsky’s introspective
letters we find most interesting accounts of the inspiration
from which he worked, and an eloquent defence of programme-music
in general, and his own Fourth Symphony
in particular<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. To N. F. von Meck he writes<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>: “Laroche is
entirely opposed to a programme. He thinks the composer
should leave the hearer to interpret the meaning of the work
as he pleases; that the programme limits his freedom; that
music is incapable of expressing the concrete phenomena
of the physical and mental world.... If you care to hear
my opinion on the subject, I will give it in a few words....
I think the inspiration of a symphonic work can be of two
kinds: subjective or objective. In the first instance it
expresses the personal emotion of joy or sorrow, as when a
lyric poet lets his soul flow out in verse. Here a programme
is not only unnecessary, but impossible. It is very different
when the composer’s inspiration is stirred by the perusal
of some poem, or by the sight of a fine landscape, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
endeavours to express his impressions in musical forms. In
this case a programme is indispensable.... To my mind,
both kinds of music have their <i>raison d’être</i>, and I cannot
understand those who will only admit one of these styles.
Of course every subject is not equally suitable for a symphony,
any more than for an opera; but, all the same,
programme-music can and must exist. Who would insist,
in literature, upon ignoring the epic and admitting only the
lyric element?”</p>

<p>Tchaikovsky seems to me to ignore the deepest side of
music, however; that intuition of an ordered, universal
harmony which gives to Bach his pre-eminence. Programme-music,
then, is not necessarily limited to any great extent
by that which it represents, provided the representation is
sufficiently generalised to allow the music free scope. But
it is always in danger of losing touch with the universal in
over-emphasis of the particular, becoming constrained by
its subject. Moreover it loses something of the freedom, and
independence of phenomenal existence, which is the peculiar
privilege of music and its unique prerogative among the arts,
taking on something that belongs to painting or language.
In so far as the wrong technical medium is used, just so
far aesthetic expression fails.</p>

<p>These strictures do not apparently apply, at any rate in
the same degree, where two media appealing to two different
senses are used simultaneously. We are accustomed to
correlate sight and hearing and to form through them a
single intuition. This may explain the extraordinary satisfyingness
of the Russian Ballet, in spite of its frequent
artificiality and the perverted themes and imagery that pass
unnoticed by the more healthy-minded public of England.
The episodic side, made rhythmical and ordered in its
choregraphic presentation, parallels, but does not constrain
in any great degree, the musical side. In Les Sylphides
especially the same intuition is expressed in two media.
The choregraphic artist has studied and followed out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
intuition of Chopin, and has expressed it in a different
medium. But music and dancing have much ground in
common, and consequently both are capable of serving as
the technical medium for one or the same intuition. Therefore
Les Sylphides<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is more of an artistic whole than
almost any other compound aesthetic expression. Art must
be free, and if it use two media, both must express the same
intuition&mdash;this is the root of the matter. You may appeal
simultaneously to two senses, but you must do so in the
medium proper to each sense and the intuition must be
capable of expression in those media. To appeal to one sense
through the medium proper to another is to court disaster.
We see that this must be so if, as is the case, the aesthetic
intuition has to be founded on the particular before it can
move out to discover the universal; and the particular
cannot be faithfully represented if the representation is not
as clear-cut as the intuition and the reality intuited. Art
must be free, for it is the intuition of a relation free on one
side at least, and not finally satisfied till it finds rest in
mutuality, love, free on both sides. It is the expression of
our growing understanding of the meaning of Reality.</p>

<p>No doubt music, like all other arts, has been transformed
from its original character. It is no longer imitative, though
it may have been first roused by imitative attempts; it is
no longer dependent on the harmony of bodily well-being,
though it may first have expressed such harmony. In it
spirit calls to spirit, no longer body to body. But this need
not surprise us. The foundations contribute nothing to the
beauty of a building, though upon them the building is
reared. All that is greatest in man had a very humble
beginning. Even his limbs and lungs had a plebeian
ancestry.</p>

<p>We have said nothing of the aesthetic problem of simple
tone and colour. Though Plato, and even Hegel, discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
these, it is generally accepted to-day that they do not in
fact exist in isolation from other suggestions. They always
derive a value from their suggested relations and cannot be
conceived apart from these. Such aesthetic value as clear
tones and colours have is due to the fact that the elements
they suggest and imply are few, like a sunset sky, and therefore
they do not demand any great degree of elimination in
the mind of the observer.</p>

<p>Neither have we dealt with the problem of the relative
importance of colour and form, except implicitly. The
essential factor here is, of course, that colour does not exist
<i>per se</i>. You cannot isolate a thing from its colour, in
aesthetic intuition. To begin with, colour is the basis of
visual perception, for the light by means of which the eye
perceives an object must be of some definite series of wave-lengths
of certain amplitudes balanced against one another
in some definite manner through the selective absorption
of that object, and wave-length is the physical basis of
colour. Then, secondly, colour belongs to, and is an integral
part of form. Form is not mere shape; it is determined by
tone (or wave-amplitude) and colour (or wave-frequency)
as well as by outline; and these are essential factors in the
unity and order of the whole, and so are essential factors of
the intuition.</p>

<p>What we have said, then, of symmetry and geometric
form, and of clearness of expression, together with what we
have said of the elimination that is involved in aesthetic
intuition, really covers the problem.</p>

<p>Together, yet each in its own way, colour and form arouse
in us the sense of unity and appeal to us as being in harmony
with the intuition derived from other particulars; that in
the world, under all its apparent multiplicity, there subsists
a unity which relates all things together.</p>
